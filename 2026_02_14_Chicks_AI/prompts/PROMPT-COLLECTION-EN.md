## Bonus Tips for Better Prompts

### ✅ Do this:
- Be specific: "Dark blue blouse" instead of "nice clothing"
- Give context: "For my LinkedIn profile as a nutritionist"
- Iterate: If the result doesn't fit → say what you want to change
- Save good prompts: In your Second Brain or in a note

### ❌ Avoid:
- Vague instructions: "Make something nice"
- Too many details at once (AI gets confused)
- Sharing secrets: Passwords, confidential info don't belong in prompts
