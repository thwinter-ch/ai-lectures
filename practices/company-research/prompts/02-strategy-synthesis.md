```
You are a senior, McKinsey-level strategy consultant. Using the research provided above, produce a **board-ready strategy document** that integrates the Golden Circle, Business Model Canvas, and Value Proposition Canvas.

**Language:** Respond entirely in German. Use Swiss German orthography (ss instead of ß).

**Output limit:** Maximum 10,000 words. Be thorough — this is a board-level strategy document, not a summary.

**Opening Requirement:**
Begin with a **one-sentence executive maxim** — a crisp, authoritative quote capturing the strategic thesis.

**Output Rules:**
- Consulting report style: clear headings, numbered subsections, concise paragraphs
- Each subsection starts with a 1-2 sentence executive summary, then detail
- Neutral, professional tone suitable for executives and boards
- Ground assertions in the research; mark unknowns as "TBD" with explicit assumptions
- Ensure Golden Circle ↔ BMC ↔ VPC are mutually consistent

**Visual Requirements:**
Generate actual images (not code diagrams) for key frameworks. Create each as a professional, board-ready visual:
- Business Model Canvas (9-block layout with key points filled in)
- Value Proposition Canvas (customer profile ↔ value map)
- Strategic positioning map (competitive landscape with company + competitors plotted)
- SWOT matrix (2×2 grid with key findings)

Use clean, professional styling suitable for a strategy presentation. Always produce the full text analysis first, then generate the image as a visual summary. The text is authoritative — the image is a supplement for presentations. (AI-generated images sometimes contain text errors.)

### Part 2 — Business Model Canvas

For each of the nine blocks, provide a 1-2 sentence summary, then expand with concise bullets:

1. **Key Partners** — Critical alliances and supplier relationships
2. **Key Activities** — Core operations that make the model work
3. **Key Resources** — Assets required to deliver value
4. **Value Propositions** — The bundle of benefits for each segment
5. **Customer Relationships** — How the company acquires, retains, grows customers
6. **Channels** — How value reaches customers
7. **Customer Segments** — Who the company serves (and who it doesn't)
8. **Cost Structure** — Major cost drivers and economics
9. **Revenue Streams** — How the company monetizes

Mark financial unknowns as **TBD** and specify what evidence would resolve them.

Generate an image of the completed 9-block Business Model Canvas.

### Part 3 — Value Proposition Canvas

**Customer Profile:**
- **Jobs to be Done** — Functional, emotional, and social jobs customers are trying to accomplish
- **Pains** — Obstacles, risks, and frictions (prioritize severe and frequent)
- **Gains** — Desired outcomes (distinguish must-haves from delighters)

**Value Map:**
- **Products & Services** — Offerings mapped to specific jobs
- **Pain Relievers** — How the offer removes key pains (be explicit)
- **Gain Creators** — How the offer enables gains (link to measurable outcomes)

**Conclude with a Fit Statement (2-3 sentences):** Summarize how Pain Relievers and Gain Creators address the most critical Jobs/Pains/Gains.

Generate an image of the Value Proposition Canvas showing the customer profile ↔ value map fit.

1. **Top 3 Strategic Priorities** — What the board should focus on in the next 12 months
2. **Key Risks to Mitigate** — Ranked by probability × impact
3. **AI Readiness Assessment** — Based on the AI disruption analysis from the research
4. **Investment Thesis** — Why this company is/isn't well-positioned for the next 3-5 years
