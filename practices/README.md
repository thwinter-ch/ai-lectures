# Practices

Reusable playbooks that work standalone or as part of a lecture. Each practice contains ready-to-use copy-paste prompts and clear tool recommendations.

## Index

## Status Legend

- **proven** -- Used and validated in at least one lecture
- **testing** -- Currently being tested
- **stub** -- Structure exists, content coming

## Structure

- **Simple practice** = single `.md` file (e.g., `company-research.md`)
- **Rich practice** = folder with sub-files (e.g., `writing-profile/` with prompts + guides)
- When a practice grows past 3-4 files, it graduates from a file to a folder

## Public vs. Private

Generic versions are public on GitHub. Personal customizations (your own outputs, client-specific variants) go in `docs.gitignore/` and stay out of the repo.
