# Armour-Piercing Questions for Board Directors

Questions that cut through technical jargon and force business clarity.

## The Core Questions

### 1. The Narrative Memo Test
> "Write me a one-page memo explaining what we will read about this decision in 5 years."

Forces clarity. Reveals fuzzy thinking. If they can't write it clearly, they don't understand it.

### 2. The Pre-Mortem
> "It's 2 years from now. This project has failed. Why did it fail?"

Surfaces risks that optimism obscures. Better than post-mortem — catches problems before they happen.

### 3. One-Way vs Two-Way Door
> "If this doesn't work, can we reverse it? What's the cost of reversal?"

| Type | Characteristics | Approach |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| **One-Way Door** | Irreversible, high cost to undo | Take time, deep analysis |
| **Two-Way Door** | Reversible, low cost to undo | Decide fast, course-correct |

Most decisions are two-way doors treated as one-way.

### 4. The Ownership Question
> "If this fails, who is accountable? What happens to them?"

No clear owner = no real commitment. "The team" is not an owner.

### 5. The Alternative Question
> "What did you consider instead? Why did you reject it?"

If they only considered one option, they haven't thought it through.

### 6. The Success Metric
> "In 12 months, how will we know this succeeded? What number will be different?"

Vague outcomes = vague accountability. "Better customer experience" is not a metric.

### 7. The Kill Criteria
> "Under what conditions would we stop this project?"

No kill criteria = zombie project risk. Define the exit before you enter.

## How to Use

1. **Pick 2-3 questions** per presentation — don't interrogate
2. **Ask them in writing** before the meeting — forces preparation
3. **Accept "I don't know"** — better than confident BS
4. **Follow up** — "You'll get back to me on that" must have a date

## Exercise

For your next board presentation on technology:
1. Request a one-page narrative memo 48 hours before
2. Ask the pre-mortem question during discussion
3. Classify the decision as one-way or two-way door
