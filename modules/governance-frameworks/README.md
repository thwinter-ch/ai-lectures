# Governance Frameworks

Board-level frameworks for technology investment validation and strategic questioning.

## Submodules

### House Model (`house-model/`)

A validation framework for technology investments. Every tech decision must:
1. Rest on the **Foundation** (Liquidity, Risk, Compliance)
2. Support at least two **Pillars** (Growth, Efficiency, CX, Employee Engagement)
3. Align with the **Roof** (Strategic Vision)

### Armour-Piercing Questions (`board-questions/`)

Questions that cut through jargon and force clarity:
- "What will we read about this decision in 5 years?"
- "If this project failed, why would it have failed?"
- "Is this a one-way door or two-way door decision?"
