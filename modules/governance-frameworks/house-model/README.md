# The House Model

A visual framework for validating technology investments at board level.

## The Framework

```
        ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
        │              DACH                    │
        │         Strategic Vision             │
        ├────────┬────────┬────────┬───────────┤
        │ Growth │ Effic. │   CX   │ Employee  │
        │        │        │        │ Engagem.  │
        ├────────┴────────┴────────┴───────────┤
        │           FUNDAMENT                  │
        │   Liquidity | Risk | Compliance      │
        └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## How to Use

When evaluating any technology investment, ask:

### 1. Foundation Check
- Does this maintain or improve liquidity?
- Does this reduce or introduce risk?
- Does this support compliance requirements?

**If any foundation element is compromised, stop.**

### 2. Pillar Validation
The investment must support **at least two pillars**:

| Pillar | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Growth** | Does this enable new revenue or market expansion? |
| **Efficiency** | Does this reduce cost or improve productivity? |
| **Customer Experience** | Does this improve customer satisfaction or retention? |
| **Employee Engagement** | Does this improve employee satisfaction or capability? |

### 3. Roof Alignment
- Does this align with our stated strategic vision?
- Is this where we want to be in 5 years?

## Red Flags

- "It's a strategic investment" without pillar justification
- Efficiency gains only (single pillar = fragile)
- Foundation compromises justified by "future growth"
- No clear answer to "What happens if this fails?"

## Exercise

Take a current technology proposal and run it through the House Model:
1. Draw the house
2. Label which pillars the proposal claims to support
3. Verify foundation is solid
4. Challenge any single-pillar justifications
