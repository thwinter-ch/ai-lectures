## Translation Guidelines

**Swiss German orthography rules:**
- No ß — always use "ss" (Strasse, nicht Straße)
- Standard Hochdeutsch vocabulary and grammar
- Formal register (Sie, not du)
- Keep technical terms in English where appropriate (AI, GitHub, Notion)
- Audience: senior executives in finance

**File structure after translation:**
- Keep English originals as `filename.md`
- Add German versions as `filename.de.md` OR replace originals if German-only delivery

## Gamma Prompt Workflow

**How to use gamma-prompt.md files:**

1. Open [gamma.app](https://gamma.app)
2. Click "Create" → "Paste in text"
3. Copy entire content of `gamma-prompt.md`
4. Paste into Gamma's text input
5. Select presentation style/theme
6. Generate slides
7. Export and save to segment folder

**Test each prompt before bulk generation.**
