## What You'll Build

By the end of this session, you'll have a working personal productivity system:

1. **Writing style profile** — AI that writes like you
2. **Company research document** — Structured business analysis with AI
3. **Second Brain** — Notion database with AI integration

This isn't theory. You'll leave with a functioning system you can use Monday morning.

## Prerequisites (Complete Before Feb 7)

### Required

### Why the Paid Version?

For the Second Brain exercise, we build a system where AI automatically writes to your Notion database:

| Platform | Read Notion | Write to Notion |

## The System I Use (Demo)

```
Voice Input (Wispr Flow)
        |
        v
   Raw Content
        |
        v
  GitHub (markdown)  <---->  Claude Pro  <---->  Notion (databases)
        |                        |
        v                        v
Version-controlled          Classified,
knowledge base              searchable
                           second brain
```

**Key principle:** Knowledge is stored in portable markdown (not locked in proprietary tools). AI connects and classifies. Notion makes it searchable.

*Wispr Flow ([wisprflow.ai](https://wisprflow.ai)) is part of my workflow that I demo in the session — not a prerequisite for the exercises.*
