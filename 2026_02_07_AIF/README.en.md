## What You'll Build

By the end of this session, you'll have a working personal productivity system:

1. **GitHub repository** — Your version-controlled knowledge base
2. **Notion database** — Your searchable "second brain"
3. **Writing style profile** — AI that writes like you
4. **Company research document** — Structured business analysis
5. **Working AI integrations** — GitHub + Notion + Claude

This isn't theory. You'll leave with a functioning system you can use Monday morning.

| **Claude Pro** | $20/mo | AI with Notion write capability | [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) |

### Why Claude Pro?

We validated all major AI platforms for Notion integration:

| Platform | Read Notion | Write to Notion | Setup |

**Claude Pro and Perplexity Pro** both offer native Notion write capability. For this session we recommend Claude Pro for its Projects feature (persistent context).

## The System You're Building

```
Voice Input (Wispr Flow)
        |
        v
   Raw Content
        |
        v
  GitHub (markdown)  <---->  Claude Pro  <---->  Notion (databases)
        |                        |
        v                        v
Version-controlled          Classified,
knowledge base              searchable
                           second brain
```

**Key principle:** Your knowledge is stored in portable markdown (not locked in proprietary tools). AI connects and classifies. Notion makes it searchable.
