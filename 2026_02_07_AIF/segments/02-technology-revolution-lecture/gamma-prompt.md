# GAMMA Prompt — Technology Revolution Segment

**Duration:** 15 minutes | **Slides:** 10–12

---

## Overall Style

- Dark, modern theme — tech-forward but not gimmicky
- Minimal text per slide — diagrams and visuals carry weight
- Blueprint/schematic aesthetic where appropriate
- No generic "AI robot" imagery — focus on systems and architecture
- Icons: clean, monoline, technical

---

## Slide 1: Title

**Title:** The Technology Revolution
**Subtitle:** Why 2026 Is Different

**Visual:** Simple timeline with 2026 marked as inflection point

**Talking points:**
- Quick poll: "Who has tried delegating a multi-step task to AI?"
- Set up the thesis: the bottleneck moved

---

## Slide 2: What Shipped in 2026

**Title:** The Breakthrough Stack

**Layout:** 5 horizontal cards with icons

| Icon | Capability | One-liner |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Chip | Hardware Cycle | Consumer devices finally AI-ready |
| Clock | Sustained Attention | Agents focus for hours, not seconds |
| Brain | Memory Scaffolding | The "amnesiac agent" problem is solved |
| Plug | MCP + Skills | Standardized tool connections |
| Mouse | Browser/File Use | Autonomous computer interaction |

**Visual:** Each capability as a building block stacking up

**Talking points:**
- "This isn't a roadmap. This shipped."
- "The pieces are assembled"

---

## Slide 3: The Missing Piece

**Title:** What's Still Missing

**Layout:** Two-column comparison

| What We Have | What We're Missing |
|--------------|-------------------|
| MCP | Intuitive UX |
| Browser automation | Task formulation skill |
| File manipulation | Delegation muscle |
| Memory persistence | Clear handoff protocols |
| Hours of sustained work | Organized systems |

**Visual:** Left column checkmarks, right column question marks

**Key quote to display:** "The bottleneck moved from 'can AI do this?' to 'can YOU define what needs to be done?'"

**Talking points:**
- The engine works. The interface is missing.
- Until it exists, YOU are the translation layer.

---

## Slide 4: You Are the Translation Layer

**Title:** The New Bottleneck

**Layout:** Funnel diagram

```
Messy Human Intent
       ↓
  [YOU — Translation Layer]
       ↓
Structured, Decomposed Tasks
       ↓
  [Agent — Execution Layer]
       ↓
    Output
```

**Visual:** Clear funnel with "YOU" highlighted as the critical conversion point

**Talking points:**
- Two-part architecture: translation + execution
- Agents excel at execution
- Translation is currently a human skill

---

## Slide 5: The Architecture That Works

**Title:** Translation + Execution

**Layout:** Two horizontal boxes with arrow between

| Layer | What It Does | Who Does It |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Translation** | Converts intent to tasks, handles ambiguity | You (for now) |
| **Execution** | Reliable completion, reporting | Agents |

**Visual:** Simple two-box diagram with handoff arrow

**Key insight to display:** "LLM work product is finally good enough. The output quality crossed the threshold."

**Talking points:**
- This is why your skill at task formulation matters
- The interface layer is being built — you're the early adopter

---

## Slide 6: Who Builds Your Mini-Me First?

**Title:** The Race That Matters

**Layout:** Three paths/options

| Path | Who | Outcome |
|------|-----|---------|
| 1 | **You** | AI accumulates context, delegation compounds |
| 2 | **Your competitor** | They get the compounding advantage |
| 3 | **Nobody** | Stuck in manual mode while others scale |

**Visual:** Three diverging arrows, one going up, one flat, one declining

**Talking points:**
- First-mover advantage is real here
- AI context accumulates — this isn't a one-time setup
- The gap widens monthly

---

## Slide 7: The Cost of Waiting

**Title:** Why This Year Matters

**Layout:** Simple timeline with annotations

```
2026: Build your AI context → compound returns
2027: Catch-up becomes significantly harder
2028: Early movers have 24 months of trained context
```

**Visual:** Widening gap diagram between "built early" and "waited"

**Talking points:**
- Others build institutional knowledge while you don't
- Playing catch-up in 2027 is painful
- This is infrastructure, not a one-off project

---

## Slide 8: Applications for Financial Services

**Title:** What Agents Can Do Now

**Layout:** 4-column table

| Domain | Agent Capability | You Define |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| Due Diligence | Research 20 sources | What's a red flag for YOUR deals |
| Client Prep | Build briefing docs | Your format, your emphasis |
| Market Monitoring | Track signals continuously | What signals matter to YOU |
| Report Generation | Draft board materials | Your voice, your structure |

**Visual:** Simple table, financial services icons

**Key line to display:** "AI can execute. It can't know what matters to you unless you've externalized it."

**Talking points:**
- These are real capabilities, available now
- The constraint is your ability to specify context

---

## Slide 9: The Three Things You Need

**Title:** What Makes It Work

**Layout:** Three numbered cards

| # | Component | Today's Exercise |
|---|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | **Writing Profile** | So AI sounds like you |
| 2 | **Research Framework** | So AI knows what questions matter |
| 3 | **Capture System** | So AI has context to work with |

**Visual:** Three cards building upward like a stack

**Talking points:**
- "These are probably not written down yet"
- "We'll build all three today"

---

## Slide 10: Bridge to Practice

**Title:** From Theory to Skill

**Subtitle:** Today's Exercises

**Layout:** Timeline of exercises

```
Next → Writing Profile (externalize your voice)
Then → Company Research (structured analysis)
Final → Second Brain (capture system)
```

**Visual:** Simple horizontal flow diagram with exercise names

**Talking points:**
- "The technology revolution already happened"
- "Today we practice the human skills that make it useful"

---

## Slide 11: The Takeaway

**Title:** One Question to Remember

**Layout:** Single quote, large text, centered

> "The question used to be 'what can AI do?' — now it's 'what can you articulate clearly enough to delegate?'"

**Visual:** Clean, minimal, quote stands alone

**Talking points:**
- Let it land
- Transition: "Let's start building your Writing Profile"

---

## Slide 12: Callback (Optional)

**Title:** How I Built This — Now You Understand

**Layout:** Quick visual reference to previous demo

- MCP connects Claude to Notion
- Memory persistence maintains context
- Always-on architecture eliminates re-explanation

**Visual:** Simplified architecture diagram from Segment 01

**Talking points:**
- Quick callback if time allows
- Reinforces that what they saw is exactly this architecture in action

---

## GAMMA Settings

- **Presentation length:** Concise (10–12 slides)
- **Tone:** Technical but accessible, executive-level
- **Color scheme:** Dark mode, tech aesthetic (deep blue/charcoal + accent)
- **Transitions:** Simple fade, no animations
- **Font:** Sans-serif, modern (Inter, SF Pro, or similar)
- **Icons:** Monoline, blueprint style

---

## Notes for GAMMA Import

When pasting this into GAMMA:

1. Start with: "Create a presentation about AI technology breakthroughs in 2026 for financial services executives"
2. Paste the slide-by-slide structure above
3. Specify: "Use minimal text, diagram-forward design, dark professional theme, no AI robot imagery"
4. Request: "Use clean icons and system architecture diagrams"

GAMMA will generate visuals — swap any that feel too generic or "tech bro."

---

## Visual Assets to Request

If creating custom visuals:

1. **Funnel diagram** — messy intent → translation layer → structured tasks → execution → output
2. **Stacking blocks** — the five breakthrough capabilities as building blocks
3. **Diverging paths** — three futures based on when you build your AI context
4. **Gap diagram** — widening distance between early movers and late adopters
5. **Two-box architecture** — translation layer (you) + execution layer (agent)

---

## Thematic Consistency

Match the visual language of other segments:
- Same dark theme as "Information Overload" (04)
- Same icon style as "Cognitive Limits" (05)
- Data-forward, not decoration-forward
- Professional financial services aesthetic, not Silicon Valley startup vibes
