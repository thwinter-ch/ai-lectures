# GAMMA Prompt: Cognitive Limits

**Presentation:** AI Productivity Hacks for Executives
**Segment:** Cognitive Limits (15 minutes)
**Slides:** 7
**Style:** Executive/professional, data-driven, minimal text, high-impact visuals

---

## Global Design Instructions

- **Color palette:** Dark professional (navy/charcoal backgrounds, white text, one accent color for emphasis)
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif, large readable text, minimal words per slide
- **Visual style:** Data visualization, infographics, icons over clipart
- **Tone:** Authoritative, slightly provocative, backed by research

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** The Cognitive Gap

**Subtitle:** Why Your Brain Needs Backup

**Visual:** Split image — left side: simplified brain icon; right side: exponential data curve rising sharply. The two visually separated by a gap/chasm.

**Speaker note:** Opening provocation — same brain as 10,000 years ago, exponentially different world.

---

## Slide 2: Miller's Law

**Title:** The 7±2 Constraint

**Main visual:** Large stylized "7±2" in center, surrounded by 7 simple geometric shapes (circles or squares) representing memory slots.

**Key text (minimal):**
- "Working memory holds ~7 items"
- "No exceptions. Biology, not discipline."

**Footer citation:** Miller, G. (1956). *Psychological Review*

**Optional callout box:** "Every executive in this room operates within the same constraint."

---

## Slide 3: Decision Fatigue

**Title:** 35,000 Daily Decisions

**Main visual:** Infographic showing a declining curve through the day — high decision quality in morning, cliff-drop by afternoon.

**Key stat callout:**
- Morning: 65% parole approval
- Pre-lunch: ~0%

**Subtext:** "Same judges. Same cases. Different time of day."

**Visual element:** Clock icon showing progression from 9am to 12pm with declining bar chart beneath.

**Footer citation:** Danziger et al. (2011). *PNAS*

---

## Slide 4: The Data Explosion

**Title:** More Data Created 2020-2025 Than All Prior Human History

**Main visual:** Dramatic timeline/hockey stick chart showing data volume growth:
- Pre-2020: Flat line
- 2020-2025: Sharp exponential rise
- Label: "97 ZB (2022) → 181 ZB (2025)"

**Definition callout:** "1 Zettabyte = 1 trillion gigabytes"

**Visual metaphor (optional):** Stack of paper reaching from Earth to Pluto, labeled "2020 data alone"

**Footer citation:** IDC Global DataSphere Forecast

---

## Slide 5: The Bottleneck

**Title:** Human Bandwidth: Fixed

**Main visual:** Horizontal bar comparison chart:
- Reading: ~250 words/min
- Typing: ~40 words/min
- Speaking: ~125 words/min
- Sustained focus: ~20-50 minutes

**Contrasting element:** Arrow pointing to "Data growth: Exponential"

**Callout box:** "100 emails × 200 words = 80 minutes of pure reading. Before you've made a single decision."

**Visual style:** Clean infographic bars, muted colors for human limits, bold accent for the data contrast.

---

## Slide 6: The Case for Augmentation

**Title:** Offload, Don't Replace

**Main visual:** Three-column layout showing:

| Offload to AI | Keep for Yourself |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Memory & Recall | Judgment |
| Pattern Processing | Context |
| First-Draft Creation | Ethics & Strategy |

**Visual style:** Left column in blue/purple (AI), right column in warm color (human). Clear visual distinction.

**Key phrase at bottom:** "AI extends thinking. It doesn't replace it."

**Icon suggestions:** Brain + gear icon for AI side; compass/north star icon for human side.

---

## Slide 7: Bridge to Action

**Title:** Your Second Brain

**Main visual:** Simple system diagram:

```
[Capture] → [Organize] → [Process] → [Surface]
    ↓           ↓           ↓           ↓
  GitHub     Notion        AI       Decisions
```

**Key text:** "External memory for a 7-item brain in a 181 ZB world."

**Transition text (bottom):** "Let's build it. →"

**Visual style:** Flow diagram with icons representing each component. Forward arrow suggesting movement to next module.

## GAMMA Generation Notes

**Aspect ratio:** 16:9
**Animation:** Subtle builds preferred over complex transitions
**Image style:** Abstract/conceptual over literal photography
**Data visualization:** Clean, minimal chartjunk, let the numbers speak

**Avoid:**
- Stock photos of people staring at laptops
- Busy backgrounds
- More than 20 words per slide
- Bullet-heavy text slides

**Emphasize:**
- Single powerful statistics per slide
- Visual contrast between human limits and data explosion
- Clean iconography
- White space

## Prompt for GAMMA (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
Create a 7-slide presentation segment titled "The Cognitive Gap: Why Your Brain Needs Backup" for an executive audience at a financial services lecture on AI productivity.

Slides:
1. Title: "The Cognitive Gap" - Split visual of brain vs exponential data curve
2. "The 7±2 Constraint" - Miller's Law, working memory limit, large "7±2" central
3. "35,000 Daily Decisions" - Decision fatigue, declining quality curve through day, parole judge study (65% morning → 0% pre-lunch)
4. "Data Explosion" - Hockey stick chart, "More data 2020-2025 than all prior history," 97ZB→181ZB
5. "The Bottleneck" - Human bandwidth stats (250 wpm reading, 40 wpm typing), contrast with exponential data growth
6. "The Case for Augmentation" - Two-column: what to offload (memory, patterns, drafts) vs what to keep (judgment, context, ethics)
7. "Your Second Brain" - System flow: Capture→Organize→Process→Surface mapped to GitHub→Notion→AI→Decisions

Style: Dark professional backgrounds, minimal text, data visualization focus, clean sans-serif typography. Executive/authoritative tone. Include source citations in footers where applicable.

Avoid: Stock photos, busy backgrounds, bullet lists, more than 20 words per slide.
