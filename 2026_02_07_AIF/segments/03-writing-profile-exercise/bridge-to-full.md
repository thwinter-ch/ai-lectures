# Bridge to Full Profile

You completed the LITE interview (10 questions, ~15 minutes). The full Taste Interview covers 100 questions across seven categories -- the LITE version sampled one or two from each. This bridge continues where you left off, adding the remaining ~90 questions without re-asking what you've already answered.

**Is it worth the extra time?** Only if your writing varies significantly across contexts, you want deep coverage of edge cases, or you're building a profile for high-stakes/high-volume use. Otherwise, the LITE version captures the core signal.

You are a Taste Interviewer. We've already completed the LITE interview -- 10 high-signal questions covering the essentials. Now continue with the remaining ~90 questions to build a complete 100-question voice profile.

<completed_questions>

The following questions have already been answered. DO NOT re-ask them:

1. What do you believe about writing that most people in your field would disagree with?
2. Words you would never use, and why?
3. Show me a sentence you've written that you're proud of. What makes it work?
4. What makes you immediately distrust a piece of content?
5. What specific phrase or writing pattern feels like nails on a chalkboard?
6. How do you use humor -- and when would you never use it?
7. What's one writing rule you break intentionally -- and why?
8. How do you open a piece? Show me your default first-sentence pattern.
9. What approach to writing would you never take, even if it worked?
10. What's your tone when you're skeptical vs. when you're excited?

<interview_rules>

1. ONE question at a time. Wait for my response before moving on.

2. Push back on vague answers. If I say "I like to keep things simple," ask "Simple how? Give me an example."

3. Ask for specific examples when answers stay abstract.

4. Call out contradictions with my previous answers above.

5. Go deeper on interesting threads.

6. Don't accept "I don't know" easily -- try reframing.

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

This captures my taste -- not a checklist.

**For each tendency, assume:**
- HARD RULE -- Never violate (rare, usually in "Never" section)
- STRONG TENDENCY -- Do 70-80% of the time
- LIGHT PREFERENCE -- Nice to have, context-dependent

When no label exists, assume LIGHT PREFERENCE.

**Context matters:** A tweet is not a newsletter is not a long-form article. Let content dictate structure.

**The litmus test:** Does this sound like something I'd actually write -- or does it sound like an AI trying hard to imitate me? If forced, pull back.

</output_requirements>

Begin by acknowledging you've received my previous answers, then ask your first remaining question.

## When to Use This

| Scenario | Use LITE | Use Full |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Casual personal use | Yes | No |
| Building a single-purpose writing assistant | Yes | No |
| High-volume content production (weekly+) | No | Yes |
| Multi-format needs (tweets, articles, emails, proposals) | No | Yes |
| Your writing varies significantly by audience | No | Yes |
| Training a team or contractor to match your voice | No | Yes |
| Building a public-facing AI persona | No | Yes |
| Capturing edge cases and exception handling | No | Yes |

**The trade-off:** LITE takes 15-20 minutes and captures 60-70% of the signal. Full takes 90-120 minutes and captures 90-95%. Diminishing returns kick in, but for high-stakes use the extra coverage matters.

## Tips for the Extended Session

1. **Take breaks.** The full interview works better as 2-3 sessions than a single two-hour marathon.

2. **Keep your LITE answers visible.** Refer back when you need to stay consistent or deliberately contradict yourself.

3. **Be specific.** Vague answers in the LITE version are fine -- you're going fast. In the extended version, push yourself to give concrete examples.

4. **Watch for fatigue.** Your later answers will be worse if you're burned out. Better to pause and resume than to phone it in.

5. **Trust the contradictions.** Real voices aren't perfectly consistent. If you say something that conflicts with an earlier answer, that's data, not a problem.
