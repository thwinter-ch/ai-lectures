## The Meta Point

This lecture was built using this exact stack:
- **Wispr Flow** for initial brainstorm (voice → text)
- **Perplexity** for research and structure
- **Claude Code** for planning + parallel agent execution
- **GAMMA** for slides (via prompts we're creating now)
- **Notion** for knowledge capture

**The tools you'll learn today are the same ones I use to teach you.**
