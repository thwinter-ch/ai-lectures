# Information Overload — Speaker Script

**Segment:** 04 | **Duration:** 15 minutes | **Position:** Before Company Research Exercise

---

## Opening Hook [0:00–1:30]

> "Raise your hand if you've ever spent 30 minutes in your inbox before actually starting your real work."
>
> [Pause for hands]
>
> "Now keep it raised if you felt productive doing that."
>
> [Pause — hands drop]

**Key point:** We've confused information consumption with information value.

## The Numbers [1:30–4:00]

Present these stats — let them land:

| Metric | Data | Source |
|--------|------|--------|
| Emails/day (exec) | **120+** | McKinsey, 2023 |
| Time on email | **28%** of workweek | McKinsey, 2023 |
| Slack messages | **200+** unread/day (avg knowledge worker) | Slack internal data |
| Meeting hours | **23 hours/week** (manager+) | Microsoft Work Trend Index |
| Decision fatigue onset | After **~10,000 bits** of info | Vohs et al., decision science |

**Emphasis:** "That's 11+ hours a week just on email. Before Slack. Before meetings. Before the actual work."

**Rhetorical beat:** "And here's the kicker — has the quality of your decisions improved proportionally?"

---

## The Paradox [4:00–6:30]

**Core thesis:** More information ≠ better decisions.

Walk through this framework:

```
Information Volume      Decision Quality
    ↑↑↑↑                    ↗ → → ↘

    (diminishing returns, then negative)
```

**Three failure modes:**

1. **Analysis paralysis** — Too many inputs, no action
2. **Signal drowning** — Critical info buried in noise
3. **Context switching tax** — 23 minutes to refocus after interruption (UC Irvine study)

**Provocative framing:** "Your competitors aren't the ones who read more. They're the ones who read *the right things faster*."

---

## The Old Model vs. The New Model [6:30–9:00]

**Old mental model (pre-AI):**

- Subscribe to everything
- Read broadly to stay informed
- More inputs = better pattern recognition
- Personal filters = competitive advantage

**Why it worked:** Information was scarce and expensive.

**New reality:**

- Information is infinite and free
- Human bandwidth is the bottleneck
- Personal filters can't scale
- Curation is the new edge

**The shift:**

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| "Consume everything" | "AI-curated relevance" |
| "I need to stay on top of it" | "AI surfaces what matters" |
| "More data = better decisions" | "Right data = faster decisions" |
| "Fear of missing out" | "Fear of drowning" |

**Key line:** "The executive advantage used to be access to information. Now it's escape velocity from information."

---

## What AI Changes [9:00–12:00]

**Three capabilities that break the overload cycle:**

1. **Synthesis at scale**
   - Read 50 sources in seconds
   - Extract and cross-reference
   - Surface contradictions and patterns

2. **Relevance filtering**
   - Match incoming info to your specific context
   - Priority scoring based on your decisions
   - "Show me what changes my plan"

3. **On-demand depth**
   - Shallow scan → deep dive only when needed
   - No more "just in case" reading
   - Research as a pull action, not push

**Practical example:** "Instead of reading 20 analyst reports on a potential partner, you ask: 'What are the three things about this company that would kill the deal?' — and get an answer in 90 seconds."

---

## Bridge to Exercise [12:00–14:00]

**Setup for Company Research exercise:**

"In 15 minutes, you're going to do something that used to take a junior analyst 2 days."

Walk them through what they'll do:

1. **Pick a company** — one you're actually curious about (competitor, partner, acquisition target)
2. **Use the research prompt** — structured, McKinsey-style output
3. **Get a briefing** — executive summary, risks, financials, competitive positioning

**Why this matters for them:**

- Due diligence before meetings
- Competitive intelligence
- Investment screening
- Partnership evaluation
- Board prep

**The meta point:** "This is information overload in reverse. Instead of consuming everything and hoping patterns emerge, you define the question and let AI do the heavy lifting."

---

## Close [14:00–15:00]

**One-liner to remember:**

> "The question isn't 'how do I read more?' — it's 'how do I ask better questions?'"

**Transition:**

"Let's put this into practice. Open your browser, navigate to [Perplexity/Claude], and let's research a company you actually care about."

## Timing Checkpoints

| Time | You should be at... |
|------|---------------------|
| 1:30 | Finished opening hook |
| 4:00 | Finished stats |
| 6:30 | Finished paradox |
| 9:00 | Finished old vs. new |
| 12:00 | Finished AI capabilities |

## If Running Short

- Cut the "Three failure modes" section (save 1 min)
- Compress old/new comparison to single slide (save 1.5 min)

## If Running Long

- Drop the UC Irvine stat
- Skip the table comparison, just hit the "escape velocity" line

## Key Phrases to Land

- "Information escape velocity"
- "Curation is the new edge"
- "Pull, not push"
- "Define the question, not the reading list"
