# GAMMA Prompt — Information Overload Segment

**Duration:** 15 minutes | **Slides:** 8–10

---

## Overall Style

- Clean, modern, dark or navy background with high-contrast text
- Minimal text per slide — visuals carry the message
- Data-forward: stats should be the visual anchor
- No stock photos of stressed executives staring at screens (overdone)
- Icons: simple, monoline style

---

## Slide 1: Title

**Title:** Information Overload
**Subtitle:** Why More Data ≠ Better Decisions

**Visual:** Single icon — inbox with "99+" badge or overflowing email tray

**Talking points:**
- Quick hook: "Before we start — who checked email in the last hour?"
- Set up the problem we're solving

---

## Slide 2: The Brutal Numbers

**Title:** The Executive Information Diet

**Layout:** 4 stat cards in grid

| Stat | Number | Context |
|------|--------|---------|
| Emails/day | 120+ | Average executive |
| Time on email | 28% | Of total work week |
| Unread Slack | 200+ | Daily for knowledge workers |
| Meeting hours | 23/week | Manager level and up |

**Visual:** Each stat as a large number with small label below

**Talking points:**
- Let the numbers breathe — don't rush
- "That's 11 hours a week on email alone"
- "Has decision quality improved proportionally?"

---

## Slide 3: The Paradox

**Title:** More Information ≠ Better Decisions

**Visual:** Line graph showing:
- X-axis: Information Volume
- Y-axis: Decision Quality
- Line rises, plateaus, then curves downward

**Talking points:**
- Diminishing returns are real
- Past a threshold, more info hurts
- We've hit that threshold

---

## Slide 4: Three Failure Modes

**Title:** How Overload Kills Performance

**Layout:** Three columns with icons

| Icon | Failure Mode | One-liner |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| Spinning wheel | Analysis Paralysis | Too many inputs, no action |
| Waves over head | Signal Drowning | Critical info buried in noise |
| Split arrows | Context Switching | 23 min to refocus after interruption |

**Talking points:**
- Pick one that resonates with the room
- "Which one costs you the most?"

---

## Slide 5: The Old Model

**Title:** What Used to Work

**Layout:** Vertical list with checkmarks

- Subscribe to everything
- Read broadly to stay informed
- More inputs = better pattern recognition
- Personal filters = competitive advantage

**Visual:** Vintage newspaper/magazine stack icon

**Talking points:**
- This made sense when information was scarce
- "Your grandfather's information diet"

---

## Slide 6: The New Reality

**Title:** The Shift

**Layout:** Two-column comparison

| Old World | New World |
|-----------|-----------|
| Information was scarce | Information is infinite |
| Human bandwidth scaled | Human bandwidth is fixed |
| Access was the edge | Curation is the edge |
| FOMO (missing out) | FODO (drowning) |

**Visual:** Simple left/right split, contrasting colors

**Key quote to display:** "The executive advantage used to be access. Now it's escape velocity."

**Talking points:**
- Pause on "escape velocity"
- Let them feel the shift

---

## Slide 7: What AI Changes

**Title:** Three Capabilities That Break the Cycle

**Layout:** Three horizontal cards

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|--------------|
| Synthesis at Scale | Read 50 sources in seconds, surface patterns |
| Relevance Filtering | Match info to your context, score priority |
| On-Demand Depth | Shallow scan, deep dive only when needed |

**Visual:** Simple icons — stacked papers, funnel, magnifying glass

**Talking points:**
- "Instead of reading 20 analyst reports, ask one question"
- Demonstrate the mental model shift

---

## Slide 8: The Mindset Shift

**Title:** From Push to Pull

**Layout:** Simple arrow diagram

```
OLD: Information → You → Filter → Maybe Use
NEW: Question → AI → Relevant Answer → Action
```

**Visual:** Two flow diagrams, top one cluttered, bottom one clean

**Talking points:**
- "Define the question, not the reading list"
- "Research becomes a pull action"

---

## Slide 9: Bridge to Exercise

**Title:** Let's Put This Into Practice

**Subtitle:** Company Research in 15 Minutes

**Layout:** Numbered list

1. Pick a company you're curious about
2. Use the structured research prompt
3. Get a McKinsey-style briefing

**Use cases (small icons):**
- Due diligence
- Competitive intel
- Investment screening
- Partnership evaluation

**Visual:** Simple document icon with checkmark

**Talking points:**
- "This used to take a junior analyst 2 days"
- "Pick something you actually care about"

---

## Slide 10: The Takeaway

**Title:** One Question to Remember

**Layout:** Single quote, large text, centered

> "The question isn't 'how do I read more?' — it's 'how do I ask better questions?'"

**Visual:** Clean, minimal, quote stands alone

**Talking points:**
- Let it land
- Transition: "Open your browser, let's do this"

---

## GAMMA Settings

- **Tone:** Professional, direct
- **Color scheme:** Dark mode preferred, or high-contrast corporate

## Notes for GAMMA Import

When pasting this into GAMMA:

1. Start with: "Create a presentation about information overload for executives"
2. Paste the slide-by-slide structure above
3. Specify: "Use minimal text, data-forward design, dark professional theme"
4. Request: "No stock photos, use simple icons and clean charts"

GAMMA will generate visuals — review and swap any that feel generic.
