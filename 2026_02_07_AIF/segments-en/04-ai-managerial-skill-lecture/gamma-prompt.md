# GAMMA Prompt: AI as Managerial Skill

**Presentation:** AI Productivity Hacks for Executives
**Segment:** AI as Managerial Skill (15 minutes)
**Slides:** 8
**Style:** Executive/professional, data-driven, contrast visuals, strategic framing

---

## Global Design Instructions

- **Color palette:** Dark professional (navy/charcoal backgrounds, white text, orange or red accent for warning/contrast data)
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif, large readable text, minimal words per slide
- **Visual style:** Data callouts, comparative diagrams, strategic frameworks
- **Tone:** Challenging, evidence-based, actionable

---

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Title:** AI is a Management Skill

**Subtitle:** Why 80% Quit After 3 Weeks

**Visual:** Split visual — left side shows declining adoption curve, right side shows rising performance curve. Gap between them highlighted.

**Key stat callout:** "Microsoft | 300,000 employees"

**Speaker note:** Microsoft study tracked 300k employees. 80% abandoned AI tools after first 3 weeks. Not an adoption problem — a skill gap we haven't named.

---

## Slide 2: The 201 Gap

**Title:** The Missing Middle

**Visual:** Three-tier pyramid or staircase:
- Top tier (small): "Expert" — Fine-tuning, agents, architecture
- Middle tier (empty/highlighted gap): "201" — ???
- Bottom tier: "101" — "Here's ChatGPT. Try a prompt."

**Key text:** "The skills between 'I tried it' and 'I'm rebuilding workflows'"

**Callout box:** "The 20% who stayed expected management. The 80% who quit expected magic."

**Speaker note:** Two levels of training exist: basic intro and expert technical. Missing: the 201 skills that determine who succeeds.

## Slide 3: The Jagged Frontier

**Title:** The Jagged Frontier

**Visual:** Dramatic illustration showing:
- A wavy, irregular line (not straight) representing AI capability boundary
- Tasks plotted above and below the line
- Some "easy-looking" tasks below frontier (AI fails)
- Some "hard-looking" tasks above frontier (AI succeeds)

**Key stats (contrasting):**
| Inside Frontier | Outside Frontier |
|-----------------|------------------|
| +12% tasks | -19% accuracy |
| +25% faster | Worse than no AI |
| +40% quality | |

**Subtitle:** "You can't tell where the line is by looking."

**Footer citation:** BCG-Harvard Study, 758 consultants (2023)

**Speaker note:** BCG-Harvard found AI users performed significantly worse on tasks outside AI's capability frontier. The frontier is uneven — some hard tasks are easy for AI, some easy tasks are beyond it.

---

## Slide 4: Management Skills, Not Prompting

**Title:** The Skills That Actually Predict Success

**Visual:** Two-column comparison:

| What People Think | What Actually Works |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Better prompts | Clear instructions |
| More features | Checking execution |
| Newer models | Understanding limits |
| Prompt templates | Knowing when to delegate |

**Key phrase centered:** "AI success requires the same skills as managing a junior analyst."

**Icon suggestion:** Left column: technology icons (keyboard, code). Right column: management icons (checklist, people, strategy).

**Speaker note:** The skills that predict AI success are management skills — scoping, verification, capability awareness. Organizations teach AI as tech; should teach it as management.

---

## Slide 5: Centaurs vs Cyborgs

**Title:** Two Patterns That Work

**Visual:** Side-by-side comparison diagram:

**Left: CENTAUR**
- Visual: Half-human/half-horse silhouette OR clear vertical dividing line
- Label: "Clear Division"
- Bullet: "I do strategy, AI does draft"
- Bullet: "Clean handoffs"
- Bullet: "Best for: Defined tasks"

**Right: CYBORG**
- Visual: Human figure with integrated circuits OR blended gradient
- Label: "Continuous Integration"
- Bullet: "Constant back-and-forth"
- Bullet: "Fluid, intertwined"
- Bullet: "Best for: Creative exploration"

**Key text at bottom:** "The 20% who succeed switch between modes. The 80% who quit never developed either."

**Speaker note:** BCG study identified two work patterns. Centaurs divide labor clearly. Cyborgs integrate continuously. Neither is universally better — context determines which.

---

## Slide 6: The Six 201 Skills

**Title:** The Six Skills That Actually Matter

**Visual:** Six-box grid or numbered list with icons:

| # | Skill | What It Is |
|---|-------|------------|
| 1 | Context Quality | Right background, constraints, examples |
| 2 | Quality Judgment | Know when to trust, when to verify |
| 3 | Task Decomposition | Strategic chunking, not all-or-nothing |
| 4 | Iterative Refinement | First draft solved; now edit |
| 5 | Workflow Integration | Part of process, not side tool |
| 6 | Frontier Awareness | Know what AI can/cannot do in your domain |

**Key insight callout:** "These are the same skills that make someone good at managing people."

**Visual style:** Clean grid, numbered 1-6, small icons per skill, minimal text.

**Speaker note:** Six management skills that predict AI success. Same skills that make good managers: clear delegation, quality checks, capability awareness.

---

## Slide 7: The Permission Gap

**Title:** The Hidden Blocker

**Visual:** Venn diagram or barrier graphic showing:
- Circle 1: "Skill Gap"
- Circle 2: "Permission Gap"
- Overlap/Barrier highlighted

**Key text:**
"Your most conscientious employees are the most likely to opt out."

**Supporting points:**
- No permission to take longer while learning
- No permission to produce worse work temporarily
- No permission to experiment with undefined boundaries

**Callout:** "The people you most want doing 201 work will quit first without explicit permission."

**Speaker note:** It's not just skills — it's permission. High performers opt out without clear permission to learn. Create explicit psychological safety for AI experimentation.

---

## Slide 8: Bridge to Self-Knowledge

**Title:** Where We Start

**Visual:** Foundation/building block diagram:
- Bottom layer (highlighted): "Know Yourself" — Context Quality Foundation
- Arrow pointing up to: Writing Profile, Company Research, Second Brain

**Key text:** "The first 201 skill requires knowing yourself well enough to give AI the right context."

**Transition text:** "Let's build your Writing Profile. →"

**Supporting points:**
- How do you think?
- What's your communication style?
- What do you value in output?

**Speaker note:** First skill is context quality. That starts with self-knowledge. Writing Profile exercise captures how you work — foundation for everything else we build today.

## GAMMA Generation Notes

**Aspect ratio:** 16:9
**Animation:** Builds on data/stats preferred; minimal slide-to-slide transitions
**Image style:** Abstract/conceptual, strategic diagrams, comparison layouts
**Data visualization:** High-contrast numbers, before/after comparisons

**Avoid:**
- Stock photos of people at computers
- Generic "AI brain" imagery
- Bullet-heavy text slides
- More than 25 words per slide

**Emphasize:**
- Contrasting data (inside vs outside frontier)
- Strategic frameworks (Centaur/Cyborg, Six Skills)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Single powerful insight per slide

4. "Management Skills, Not Prompting" - Two-column comparison: what people think works vs what actually works
5. "Centaurs vs Cyborgs" - Side-by-side comparison of two AI work patterns: clear division vs continuous integration
6. "The Six 201 Skills" - Six-box grid: Context Quality, Quality Judgment, Task Decomposition, Iterative Refinement, Workflow Integration, Frontier Awareness
7. "The Permission Gap" - Venn diagram showing skill gap + permission gap, key insight about conscientious employees opting out
8. "Where We Start" - Foundation diagram leading to Writing Profile exercise

## Connection to Lecture Arc

**Before this segment:** Cognitive Limits (why your brain needs AI backup)
**This segment:** AI as Managerial Skill (what skills make AI work)
**After this segment:** Writing Profile exercise (first practical application of context quality)

**The bridge:** The six 201 skills are management skills. The first skill (context quality) requires knowing yourself. That's what the Writing Profile captures.
