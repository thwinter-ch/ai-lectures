## Slide 1: The Uncomfortable Data (1.5 min)

**[OPEN WITH SHOCK]**

"Microsoft tracked 300,000 employees using Copilot. Let me tell you what they found.

80% abandoned AI tools after the first three weeks.

Not 80% of underperformers. Not 80% of the technically challenged. 80% of everyone. Your best employees included.

**[PAUSE]**

This isn't an adoption problem. It's a skill gap we haven't named yet."

## Slide 2: The 201 Gap (2 min)

**[FRAME THE PROBLEM]**

"We have two levels of AI training right now:

**101 Level:** 'Here's ChatGPT. Write a prompt. Magic happens.'
**Expert Level:** Fine-tuning, RAG architectures, agent deployment.

What's missing? The 201 level. The skills between 'I tried it once' and 'I'm rebuilding workflows.'

The Microsoft data tells us exactly who made it through that 3-week trough: People who expected management. Not prompting tricks. Management.

**[KEY DISTINCTION]**

The 80% who quit? They expected a better search engine or a magic answer machine. When it wasn't that, they left. The 20% who stayed? They understood they were managing a capable but unreliable team member."

## Slide 3: The Jagged Frontier (2.5 min)

**[INTRODUCE THE RESEARCH]**

"BCG and Harvard ran a study with 758 consultants. The results will shape how you think about AI deployment.

For tasks inside AI's capabilities:
- 12% more tasks completed
- 25% faster completion
- 40% higher quality output

Sounds great. Here's the problem.

**[THE TWIST]**

For tasks outside AI's capabilities — and this is the critical part — consultants using AI performed 19 percentage points *worse* than those without AI.

Not the same. Not a little worse. Significantly worse.

**[LAND IT]**

This is what we call the 'jagged frontier.' AI capabilities aren't a neat line. They're ragged, uneven, and often invisible. Some tasks that look hard are trivially easy for AI. Some tasks that look simple are completely beyond it.

The dangerous part? You can't tell by looking. And if you don't know where the frontier is, AI doesn't just fail to help — it actively degrades your performance."

## Slide 4: Management Skills, Not Prompting Skills (2 min)

**[REFRAME]**

"So what predicts AI success? Here's the insight that changes everything.

The skills that predict AI success are management skills. Not prompting skills. Management.

Think about what good management requires:
- Giving clear instructions
- Checking work quality
- Understanding capabilities and limits
- Knowing when to delegate and when to do it yourself

**[MAKE THE CONNECTION]**

When you manage a junior analyst, you don't hand them a vague assignment and hope. You scope the task, provide context, verify output, and know which tasks they can handle.

AI requires the same discipline. The problem? Most organizations teach AI as a technology skill, not a management skill. So people use it like Google — one shot, expect perfect results, move on frustrated."

## Slide 5: Centaurs vs Cyborgs (2.5 min)

**[INTRODUCE THE PATTERNS]**

"The BCG study identified two work patterns that actually succeed with AI. They called them Centaurs and Cyborgs.

**[CENTAUR]**

Centaur work — like the mythical creature — has a clear division. Human torso, horse body. Clear boundaries.

In Centaur mode, you strategically divide labor: 'I do strategy, AI does the draft. I do judgment calls, AI does data synthesis. I verify, AI executes.'

Clean handoffs. You know what's yours and what's AI's.

**[CYBORG]**

Cyborg work is different. Continuous integration. No clear line between human and machine contribution.

In Cyborg mode, you're constantly interacting — AI starts a sentence, you finish it. You sketch an idea, AI extends it. Back and forth, fluid, intertwined.

**[WHEN TO USE WHICH]**

Neither is universally better. Centaur mode works for well-defined tasks where you understand the frontier. Cyborg mode works for creative, exploratory work where you're navigating the frontier in real-time.

The 20% who succeed? They switch between modes based on context. The 80% who quit? They never developed either pattern."

## Slide 6: The Six 201 Skills (2.5 min)

**[THE PRACTICAL FRAMEWORK]**

"Let me give you the six skills that actually matter. These are management skills, not prompting tricks.

**1. Context Quality**
Providing the right background, constraints, and examples to improve output. This is scoping — the same skill that makes a good project brief.

**2. Quality Judgment**
Knowing when to trust AI output and when to verify. Understanding quality at the document level and within the document. This is editorial judgment.

**3. Task Decomposition**
Breaking work into AI-appropriate chunks. Not throwing an entire project at the tool. Not avoiding it entirely. Strategic chunking.

**4. Iterative Refinement**
Treating AI output as a first draft. Knowing how to iterate, improve, and refine. The blank page is solved — now you're editing.

**5. Workflow Integration**
Embedding AI into how work actually gets done. Not a side tool you occasionally open. Part of the process.

**6. Frontier Awareness**
Understanding what AI can and cannot do — for your specific domain, your specific tasks. This is the judgment layer.

**[THE INSIGHT]**

Notice something? These are the same skills that make someone good at managing people. Clear delegation, quality checks, appropriate task assignment, iterative feedback, process design, capability awareness.

AI success isn't about being technical. It's about being a good manager."

## Slide 7: The Permission Gap (1.5 min)

**[SURFACE THE BLOCKER]**

"Here's what's really blocking AI adoption. It's not just a skill gap. It's a permission gap.

Your most conscientious employees — the ones who care most about doing good work — are the ones most likely to opt out.

Why? Because they don't have clear permission to:
- Take longer on the first attempt to learn the tool
- Produce potentially worse work while building proficiency
- Experiment with undefined boundaries

**[THE IRONY]**

The people you most want doing 201-level work will opt out first if you don't create explicit permission to learn."

---

## Slide 8: Bridge to Self-Knowledge (1.5 min)

**[TRANSITION TO EXERCISE]**

"So where do we start building 201 skills?

The first skill — context quality — requires something most people skip: knowing yourself well enough to give AI the right context.

How do you think? What's your communication style? What do you value in output? What are your blind spots?

**[PREVIEW THE EXERCISE]**

The Writing Profile exercise we're about to do addresses exactly this. You're going to create a document that captures how you work — your style, your preferences, your patterns.

This isn't vanity. It's the foundation for context quality. When AI knows you, it produces output worth refining. When it doesn't, you get generic slop that wastes everyone's time.

**[CLOSE THE LOOP]**

The 201 skills gap is what we're addressing today. And we start by building the judgment layer — starting with knowing yourself.

Let's get into the exercise."

**[TRANSITION CUE: Move to Writing Profile exercise]**

## Facilitator Notes

**For financial services audience:**
- The "capable but unreliable team member" framing resonates — they manage analysts
- BCG data has credibility with this audience
- Permission gap is particularly relevant in compliance-heavy cultures

**Connection to exercises:**
- Writing Profile = building context quality foundation
- Company Research = practicing task decomposition
- Second Brain = workflow integration

**Potential audience questions:**
- "What about hallucinations?" → That's quality judgment skill #2
- "Our compliance won't allow it" → Permission gap, address institutional barriers
- "Which tools should we use?" → Wrong question — 201 skills are tool-agnostic
