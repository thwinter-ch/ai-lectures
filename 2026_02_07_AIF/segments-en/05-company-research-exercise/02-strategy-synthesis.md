# Strategy Synthesis Prompt

## Instructions

**Paste your deep research output above this prompt, then run it.**

This prompt transforms raw company research into a structured strategy document using three proven frameworks.

---

## The Frameworks (30-second primer)

| Framework | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Golden Circle** | Articulates the company's purpose (Why), differentiation (How), and offerings (What) — the strategic identity. |
| **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** | Maps the nine building blocks of how the company creates, delivers, and captures value. |
| **Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)** | Zooms into customer jobs, pains, and gains — and how the company addresses them. |

---

## The Prompt

```
You are a senior, McKinsey-level strategy consultant. Using the research provided above, produce a **board-ready strategy document** that integrates the Golden Circle, Business Model Canvas, and Value Proposition Canvas.

**Opening Requirement:**
Begin with a **one-sentence executive maxim** — a crisp, authoritative quote capturing the strategic thesis.

**Output Rules:**
- One structured document (no tables, charts, or Excel)
- Consulting report style: clear headings, numbered subsections, concise paragraphs
- Each subsection starts with a 1-2 sentence executive summary, then detail
- Neutral, professional tone suitable for executives and boards
- Length: ~1,200–2,000 words
- Ground assertions in the research; mark unknowns as "TBD" with explicit assumptions
- Ensure Golden Circle ↔ BMC ↔ VPC are mutually consistent

---

### Part 1 — Golden Circle

**1. Why**
- Core statement: Single-sentence purpose
- Elaboration: Strategic implications (positioning, customer promise, culture)

**2. How**
- Core statement: Signature capabilities and principles
- Elaboration: Operating model, differentiators, proof points

**3. What**
- Core statement: Offerings and business scope
- Elaboration: Products/services and customer outcomes

---

### Part 2 — Business Model Canvas

For each of the nine blocks, provide a 1-2 sentence summary, then expand with concise bullets:

1. **Key Partners** — Critical alliances and supplier relationships
2. **Key Activities** — Core operations that make the model work
3. **Key Resources** — Assets required to deliver value
4. **Value Propositions** — The bundle of benefits for each segment
5. **Customer Relationships** — How the company acquires, retains, grows customers
6. **Channels** — How value reaches customers
7. **Customer Segments** — Who the company serves (and who it doesn't)
8. **Cost Structure** — Major cost drivers and economics
9. **Revenue Streams** — How the company monetizes

Mark financial unknowns as **TBD** and specify what evidence would resolve them.

---

### Part 3 — Value Proposition Canvas

**Customer Profile:**
- **Jobs to be Done** — Functional, emotional, and social jobs customers are trying to accomplish
- **Pains** — Obstacles, risks, and frictions (prioritize severe and frequent)
- **Gains** — Desired outcomes (distinguish must-haves from delighters)

**Value Map:**
- **Products & Services** — Offerings mapped to specific jobs
- **Pain Relievers** — How the offer removes key pains (be explicit)
- **Gain Creators** — How the offer enables gains (link to measurable outcomes)

**Conclude with a Fit Statement (2-3 sentences):** Summarize how Pain Relievers and Gain Creators address the most critical Jobs/Pains/Gains.

---

Now analyze the research above and produce the strategy document.

## What to Do with the Output

The synthesis gives you three layers of strategic clarity. Here's how to use each:

### Immediate Uses

| Output Section | Use Case |
|----------------|----------|
| **Executive Maxim** | Pitch decks, investor meetings, internal alignment documents |
| **Golden Circle** | Brand messaging, culture docs, "About Us" copy, hiring criteria |
| **BMC** | Board presentations, partnership discussions, operational planning |
| **VPC** | Product roadmaps, marketing messaging, sales enablement |

### Follow-up Actions

1. **Validate assumptions** — The synthesis will flag "TBD" items. These are your research gaps. Prioritize closing the ones that affect major decisions.

2. **Test the Fit Statement** — Does your VPC Fit Statement match what actual customers say? If not, you've found a positioning problem or a research gap.

3. **Check for contradictions** — The frameworks should reinforce each other. If your Golden Circle "Why" doesn't align with your VPC "Jobs to be Done," something's off.

4. **Build derivative artifacts:**
   - Turn the BMC into a slide for investors
   - Extract the VPC Pain Relievers for feature prioritization
   - Use the Golden Circle as input for messaging workshops

### Quality Check

Before using the output, verify:

- [ ] The executive maxim is defensible (not generic fluff)
- [ ] BMC cost/revenue structures are plausible (or flagged as TBD)
- [ ] VPC jobs match your target customer, not an idealized one
- [ ] No contradictions between Golden Circle positioning and BMC value propositions

## Workflow Summary

```
Step 1: Deep Research    → Raw analysis and facts about the company
Step 2: Strategy Synthesis → Structured frameworks (this prompt)
Step 3: Your judgment     → Validate, refine, and deploy
```

The AI does the structuring. You do the sanity check.
