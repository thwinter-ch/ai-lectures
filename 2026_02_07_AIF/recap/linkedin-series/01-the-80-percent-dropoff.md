<!-- Post 3/12 | Schedule: Day 2, AM | Topic: The 80% Drop-Off | Pillar: AI in Production -->

Microsoft tracked 300,000 Copilot users.

80% quit after 3 weeks. Not the tech-illiterate. Everyone.

They expected a better search engine. What they got was a capable but unreliable direct report that needed managing.

There's a gap nobody teaches. Call it the 201 problem.

101 is easy: open ChatGPT, type a prompt, get impressed.

301 is the dream: agents running your research, writing your docs, managing your knowledge.

201 is where everyone stalls: judging output quality, decomposing tasks, iterating on mediocre results. The skills that actually determine who gets value from AI.

The 20% who survived? They figured out 201 on their own. They treated AI like a new hire — gave it clear briefs, reviewed its work, refined their instructions.

Same skills that make someone good at managing people.

I built an entire lecture around teaching these 201 skills to finance execs. Three exercises, three real deliverables they keep. Not slides about AI. Systems they use on Monday.
