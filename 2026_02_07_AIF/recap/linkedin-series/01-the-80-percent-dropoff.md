<!-- Post 1/10 | Schedule: Day 1, AM | Topic: The 80% Drop-Off -->

Microsoft tracked 300,000 Copilot users.

80% quit after 3 weeks.

Not the tech-illiterate. Not the "old guard." Everyone. Across all departments, all seniority levels.

So what happened?

They expected a better search engine. What they got was a capable but unreliable team member that needed managing.

Here's the thing nobody talks about: there's a massive gap between the tutorial and transformation. Call it the "201 problem."

Level 101 is easy. You sign up, you ask it to write an email, you're impressed. Cool party trick.

Level 301 is the dream. AI handles your research, drafts your strategy docs, manages your knowledge. Real productivity gains.

But 201 — the part where you learn to judge output quality, decompose tasks, iterate on mediocre results — that's where everyone stalls. And nobody teaches it.

The 20% who survived that 3-week drop-off? They figured out 201 on their own. They treated AI like a new hire: gave it clear briefs, reviewed its work critically, refined their instructions.

They didn't have more technical skill. They had better management instincts.

If you're rolling out AI in your organization, stop investing in "intro to ChatGPT" workshops. Your people already know how to type a prompt.

Start investing in the 201 skills: task decomposition, quality judgment, iterative refinement.

That's where the 80% get stuck. That's where you can actually move the needle.
