<!-- Post 12/12 | Bonus | Topic: The Lecture You Deserved -->

We've all sat through that lecture.

Three hours. PowerPoint. The speaker reads bullet points you can see yourself. No exercises. No follow-up. Maybe a PDF of the slides in your inbox the next day — the same slides you already forgot.

You leave thinking: "I could have read an article."

I've been that student. And now that I'm on the other side, I refuse to be that lecturer.

Here's what my students got after a 3.5-hour session on AI productivity:

A full recap page — segment by segment, with the actual insights from the live session, not just what was on the slides. The Q&A highlights. The tangents that turned into the most valuable discussions. The honest admissions about what doesn't work yet.

Every exercise linked to a live GitHub repository. Not "here's a screenshot of the prompt." Actual markdown files they can copy, modify, and reuse tomorrow.

Key quotes pulled from the transcript. The kind you screenshot and send to your team. Because I have the transcript — AI transcribed the entire session — and pulling quotes costs me 5 minutes.

Concept diagrams. Not clip art. Custom SVG illustrations of the jagged frontier, the centaur/cyborg spectrum, the second brain architecture. Built into the page, not attached as separate files nobody opens.

A 10-post LinkedIn knowledge series distilling the lecture into standalone insights. For the students who want a refresher. For the colleagues they want to share it with. For the network that wasn't in the room.

Here's the part that bothers me:

None of this was hard. The recap took about 2 hours to produce. The LinkedIn series, another hour. The web page, another hour. Total incremental cost: roughly $8 in API calls. Eight dollars.

The transcript was free — Gemini transcribes Google Meet sessions automatically. The hosting is free — GitHub Pages. The tools are the same ones I taught in the lecture itself.

So when a lecturer hands you a slide PDF and calls it a day — it's not a resource constraint. It's an attitude.

The attitude that says: my job ended when I left the room. That the lecture is the product, and everything after is extra.

I think the opposite. The lecture is the experience. Everything after is the product. The recap, the exercises, the reference material — that's what students actually use on Monday morning.

If you have access to AI tools that can transcribe, synthesize, structure, and publish — and you choose to give students nothing — that's a choice. Not a limitation.

The bar for "good enough" just moved. And it moved because the cost of excellence dropped to almost zero.

I'm not saying every lecturer needs to build a GitHub repo. I'm saying: if you care about whether people actually learn something, the tools to make that happen are sitting right there. The only thing missing is the decision to use them.

Your students sat through enough boring lectures. Give them something worth bookmarking.
