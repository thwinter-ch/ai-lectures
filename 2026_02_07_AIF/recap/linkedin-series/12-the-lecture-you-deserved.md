<!-- Post 1/12 | Schedule: Day 1, AM | Topic: The Lecture You Deserved | Pillar: Building in the Open -->

Taught a 3.5-hour university lecture on Friday.

Here's what the students got after:

A full recap website — segment by segment, with the live discussion highlights, not just the slide content. Every exercise linked to a live GitHub repo with copy-paste prompts. Key quotes pulled from the transcript. Inline SVG diagrams. Tool reference table.

Total production time for all of that: about 4 hours.
Cost: $8 in API calls.

The transcript came free from Gemini. The hosting is free on GitHub Pages. The tools are the same ones I taught in the lecture.

I built the recap with Claude Code. Same tool the students learned to use that afternoon. The recap page is itself a demonstration of the lecture content.

Here's what bothers me: none of this was hard. The cost of giving students something actually useful dropped to almost zero. When a lecturer hands you a slide PDF and calls it a day, that's not a resource constraint. That's a choice.
