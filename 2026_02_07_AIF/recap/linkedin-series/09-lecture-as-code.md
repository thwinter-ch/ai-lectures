<!-- Post 11/12 | Schedule: Day 6, AM | Topic: Lecture as Code (workflow) | Pillar: Building in the Open -->

Built a 3.5-hour university lecture in 2 weeks. As a side project. While running a company.

The workflow:

Voice brainstorm while walking (Wispr Flow) → AI research per topic (Perplexity) → parallel agent execution for content structuring (Claude Code) → slide generation from text (Gamma) → version control (GitHub)

My role shifted. I didn't create content. I directed production.

Same shift that happened when execs stopped writing their own memos and started managing people who did. Except now the "people" are AI agents and the management cycle is minutes.

The lecture teaches AI workflows. The lecture was built with AI workflows. Deliberately. Because if you teach AI and your own lecture isn't built with AI, you're doing theory.

Total cost: ~$15 in API calls. Two weeks of evenings. Five slide decks, three hands-on exercises, bilingual documentation, a public recap page.

The entire thing is open source. Every prompt, every decision, every script.
