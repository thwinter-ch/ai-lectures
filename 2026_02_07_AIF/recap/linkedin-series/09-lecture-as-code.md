<!-- Post 9/10 | Schedule: Day 5, AM | Topic: Lecture as Code -->

I built a 3.5-hour university lecture in 2 weeks.

As a side project. While running a company.

Not because I'm exceptional. Because the production model changed.

Here's the workflow:

Voice brainstorm while walking (Wispr Flow) -> AI research on every topic (Perplexity) -> Parallel agent execution for content structuring (Claude Code) -> Slide generation from text (Gamma) -> Knowledge capture and version control (Notion + GitHub)

The lecture was built using the same AI tools it teaches. Deliberately. Because if you teach AI workflows, those workflows should have built the thing you're teaching. Anything else is theory.

But here's the part that actually matters: my role shifted.

I didn't create content. I directed production.

The difference is fundamental. Creating content means you're the one writing, designing, researching, formatting. Directing production means you define the vision, set quality standards, assign tasks to the right tools, and review output.

Same shift that happened when executives stopped writing their own memos and started managing people who did. Except now the "people" are AI agents, and the management cycle is minutes, not days.

During the live session, a student reported a broken link in the course materials. I told Claude Code to investigate. Within 2 minutes — during the lecture — the bug was found, fixed, and pushed to the public repository. Live. In front of 21 people.

That's not a party trick. That's what "lecture as code" means: the content is a living system, not a static file.

If you produce anything repeatable — reports, training, documentation, analysis — ask yourself: what would it look like if I directed production instead of doing production?

The answer might free up more time than any productivity hack you've tried.
