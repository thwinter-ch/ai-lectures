The 20% who actually succeed with AI don't use it one way.

They use it two ways. And they switch between them constantly.

The BCG-Harvard research identified two distinct work patterns among top AI performers:

**Centaur work.** Clean division of labor. You do the strategy, AI does the draft. You set the direction, AI handles the research. Clear handoffs, like a relay race.

Best for: well-defined tasks with clear inputs and outputs.

**Cyborg work.** Continuous integration. AI starts a sentence, you finish it. You outline a framework, AI fills it, you restructure, AI refines. Back and forth, fluid, almost conversational.

Best for: creative, exploratory work where the destination isn't clear yet.

Most people try one pattern and stick with it.

The people who thrive do something different. They read the task, decide which pattern fits, and switch mid-stream when the work changes character.

Strategy session? Start as a centaur. Give AI the research brief, review the output, apply your judgment.

Drafting a client proposal? Go cyborg. Let AI generate options, reshape them, ask for alternatives, merge the best parts.

The mistake is treating AI like it has one mode. It doesn't. And neither should you.

Here's a practical test for your next project: before you open an AI chat, ask yourself — is this a handoff task or a collaboration task? Then work accordingly.

That one question will improve your output more than any prompt engineering course.
