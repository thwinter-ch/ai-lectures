The top 20% of AI users don't use it one way.

They switch between two modes constantly.

𝗖𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝘂𝗿: Clean division. You do strategy, AI does the draft. Clear handoffs. Best for defined tasks with known inputs and outputs.

Cyborg: Continuous integration. AI starts, you reshape, AI refines, you redirect. Fluid. Best for creative work where the destination isn't clear.

Most people pick one and stick with it.

The people who get real value read the task, pick the right mode, and switch mid-stream when the work changes character.

Strategy session? Start centaur. Give AI the research brief, review output, apply judgment.

Client proposal? Go cyborg. Generate options, reshape, ask for alternatives, merge the best parts.

I watch this happen live in exercises. The students who produce the best company research start centaur (structured prompt, let it run) then shift cyborg when they're refining the strategic synthesis.

Nobody taught them that. They figured it out in 30 minutes because the exercise forced both modes.
