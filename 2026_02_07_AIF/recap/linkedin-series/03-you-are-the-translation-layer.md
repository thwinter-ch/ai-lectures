<!-- Post 5/12 | Schedule: Day 3, AM | Topic: You Are The Translation Layer -->

The bottleneck moved.

Two years ago: "Can AI do this?"
Today: "Can YOU define what needs to be done clearly enough to delegate it?"

In 2026, every technical barrier fell. Consumer-ready hardware. Models that maintain focus for hours. Persistent memory across sessions. Standardized tool connections. Autonomous file and browser interaction.

The technology is ready. The humans aren't.

Here's what I mean by "translation layer": there's a gap between what you vaguely want and what an AI can execute. Someone has to bridge that gap. That someone is you.

"Make this better" is not a brief. It's a wish.

"Rewrite the executive summary to lead with the risk assessment, cap it at 200 words, and match the tone of our Q3 board deck" — that's a brief.

The skills that close this gap are eerily familiar: clear delegation, explicit success criteria, iterative feedback. The same things that make someone a good manager of people.

Which means the competitive advantage in AI isn't technical. It's managerial.

The person who can take a messy, ambiguous business problem and decompose it into clear, executable tasks will outperform the person with a better prompt template every single time.

One thing you can do today: take your next AI interaction and pretend you're briefing a smart but new employee. Write the brief before you open the chat. Define the output format, the quality bar, and what "done" looks like.

Watch how much better the result gets.
