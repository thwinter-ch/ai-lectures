The bottleneck moved.

Two years ago: "Can AI do this?"

Now: "Can you define what needs to be done clearly enough to delegate it?"

Every technical barrier fell in 2026. Consumer hardware. Models that maintain focus for hours. Persistent memory. Standardized tool connections. Autonomous file and browser interaction.

The technology is ready. The humans aren't.

"Make this better" is a wish.

"Rewrite the exec summary to lead with the risk assessment, cap it at 200 words, match the tone of our Q3 board deck" — that's a brief an AI can execute.

The gap between those two sentences is the translation layer. Someone has to bridge it. That someone is you.

The competitive advantage in AI isn't technical. It's the ability to take a messy business problem and decompose it into clear, executable tasks.

Same skill that makes someone a good manager. Except now the management cycle is minutes, not days.
