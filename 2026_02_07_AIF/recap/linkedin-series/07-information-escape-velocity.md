<!-- Post 7/10 | Schedule: Day 4, AM | Topic: Information Escape Velocity -->

The executive advantage used to be access to information.

Now it's escape velocity FROM information.

Some numbers that should concern you:

- 120+ emails per day for the average executive
- 28% of the workweek spent on email alone
- 23 hours per week in meetings
- 23 minutes to refocus after a single interruption (UC Irvine)

And here's the kicker from cognitive science: your working memory holds roughly 7 items. That's Miller's Law. It applies to everyone. You, me, the CEO of Goldman Sachs. Same 7-item prison.

More data does not equal better decisions. Past a threshold, more data equals worse decisions made with higher confidence.

The Israeli Judges Study proved this brutally: parole approval dropped from 65% after breakfast to nearly 0% before lunch. Not because the cases changed. Because glucose levels changed. Every afternoon decision you make is potentially compromised — not by information asymmetry, but by biology.

The old information model was "subscribe to everything, read broadly, stay informed." That model broke when information became infinite.

The new model: define the question first, then let AI do the retrieval.

Pull, not push.

Instead of reading 50 articles to find the 3 relevant paragraphs, you ask a specific question and get a synthesized answer with sources.

Instead of attending a 60-minute meeting to catch 5 minutes of relevant content, you read an AI-generated summary filtered for your role.

The skill isn't consuming more. It's asking better questions and trusting AI to do the heavy lifting on retrieval.

Start here: pick one information stream you consume out of habit (a newsletter, a recurring meeting, a report). Replace it with an AI-driven pull workflow. See what you actually miss.

I bet it's less than you think.
