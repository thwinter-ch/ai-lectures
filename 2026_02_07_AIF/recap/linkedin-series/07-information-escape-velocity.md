The executive advantage used to be access to information.

Now it's escape velocity from it.

120+ emails/day. 28% of the workweek on email. 23 hours/week in meetings. 23 minutes to refocus after one interruption.

And Miller's Law: working memory holds ~7 items. You, me, the CEO of Goldman Sachs. Same 7-item prison.

Past a threshold, more data = worse decisions made with higher confidence. The Israeli judges study nailed this: parole approval dropped from 65% to near 0% before lunch. Not because cases changed. Because glucose levels changed.

The old model: subscribe to everything, read broadly, stay informed. That model broke when information became infinite.

New model: define the question first. Let AI retrieve and synthesize. Pull, not push.

I told a board seminar in December that personal information management was the one problem I hadn't solved. Tried Evernote, OneNote, Capacities. Same results, different logo.

Then I built a system that actually works. That's the next post.
