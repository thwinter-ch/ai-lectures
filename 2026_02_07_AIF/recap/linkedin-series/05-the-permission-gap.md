<!-- Post 5/10 | Schedule: Day 3, AM | Topic: The Permission Gap -->

Your best employees quit AI first.

Not because they're incapable. Because they're conscientious.

Think about it. Your top financial auditor has spent years building a reputation for precision. For getting it right. For being the person others rely on.

Now you hand them an AI tool and say "use this."

They try it. The output is 80% right but 20% sloppy. Their name is on it. Their reputation is on the line. So they do the rational thing.

They stop using it.

This is the Permission Gap — and it's the real AI adoption blocker hiding in plain sight.

Your most skilled, most careful, most valuable people will opt out of AI before your average performers do. Not from ignorance. From professionalism.

Because nobody told them it's okay to be temporarily worse.

Learning any new tool means a performance dip. A pianist switching techniques sounds worse for months before they sound better. A surgeon learning robotic surgery is slower before they're faster.

AI is no different. There's a learning dip. And if your culture punishes that dip — even implicitly — your best people will avoid it entirely.

Three things leaders need to do:

1. **Say it out loud.** "You have explicit permission to experiment. Temporary quality dips are expected and accepted."

2. **Protect the learning period.** Give people low-stakes projects to practice on before high-stakes deadlines.

3. **Reward the attempt, not just the output.** The person who tried AI and produced a mediocre first result is closer to transformation than the person who never tried.

The Permission Gap isn't a technology problem. It's a leadership problem. And it's yours to close.
