Your best people quit AI first.

Not because they can't. Because they're careful.

Your top financial auditor has years of reputation built on precision. You hand them an AI tool. The output is 80% right and 20% sloppy. Their name goes on it.

They stop using it. Rational decision.

This came up hard in a lecture I gave to finance execs. The longest discussion of the day — 20 minutes off-script.

One insight that landed: "Your best auditor is suddenly not the best for three months. If you don't give them permission for that dip, they'll quit either the AI or the job."

Someone said: treat it like teaching a kid to walk. Not like debugging code. Patience, not process.

The permission gap isn't a technology problem. It's a management failure. The 80% who abandon AI aren't incapable. Many are your most conscientious people making a rational choice because nobody told them it's OK to be temporarily worse.

Say it out loud. Protect the learning period. That's the intervention.
