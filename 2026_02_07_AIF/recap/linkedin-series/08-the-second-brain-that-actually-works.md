Every knowledge management system I've tried died the same way.

Setup with enthusiasm. Use for two weeks. Stop because the friction of capturing, tagging, and retrieving was just enough to kill the habit.

What changed: AI as the layer between input and storage.

Old system: hear something interesting → open notes app → type it → choose a tag → file it → later, can't find it → give up.

New system: say "save this" at the end of any Claude conversation. It summarizes, extracts key points, tags automatically, pushes to a structured Notion database. Done.

My extended setup: a Telegram channel where voice notes, photos, and text get classified by a serverless function and filed into Notion automatically. Never open a notes app.

After a few weeks of consistent feeding, you can ask: "What themes have I been thinking about this month?" And it tells you.

I teach this as a hands-on exercise. Students build the Claude-to-Notion connection in 25 minutes and walk out with a working system. Not a demo. A system they use on Monday.

The tool doesn't matter. Removing friction is what makes the habit stick.
