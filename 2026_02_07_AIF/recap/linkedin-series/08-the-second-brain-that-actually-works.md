I tried Evernote. OneNote. Capacities. Apple Notes. Notion (the first time).

Same results, different logo.

I'd set it up with great intentions. Use it for two weeks. Then slowly stop because the friction of capturing, tagging, and retrieving was just enough to kill the habit.

I told a board seminar in December 2025 that personal knowledge management was the one problem I hadn't solved. Publicly. On stage. Because I was genuinely stuck.

Here's what changed: AI as the intelligence layer between input and retrieval.

The old system: you hear something interesting. You open your notes app. You type it out. You decide on a tag. You file it. Later, you remember you saved something but can't find it. You search three apps. You give up.

The new system: you say "save this" at the end of any AI conversation. It summarizes the conversation, extracts key points, tags it automatically, and pushes it to a structured database. Done.

Or better yet: you send a voice note from your phone. An AI classifies it, extracts the actionable parts, and files it — without you ever opening a notes app.

The friction that killed every previous system? Gone.

But the real value isn't capture. It's what happens after a few weeks of feeding it consistently.

You can ask your second brain: "What themes have I been thinking about this month?" And it tells you. It becomes a mirror for your own thinking patterns.

If you want to try this, the minimum viable setup is simpler than you think:

1. Connect Claude to Notion (takes 5 minutes)
2. Create a database with fields: topic, tags, source, action items
3. End every useful AI conversation with "save the key points to my Notion"

The tool doesn't matter. The habit does. But removing friction is what makes the habit stick.
