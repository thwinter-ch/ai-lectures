"We can't use cloud AI because of the Cloud Act."

I hear this in every Swiss finance boardroom. Mostly wrong.

CLOUD = Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data. US law that lets law enforcement request data from US cloud providers even when stored abroad.

The number nobody mentions: 95% of requests get rejected by the providers themselves. Microsoft, Google, Amazon have legal teams whose job is to fight these. Because handing over customer data is terrible for business.

The real question isn't "can the US government access my data?"

It's: who is your actual adversary?

Criminal threats (hackers, ransomware): major cloud providers offer better security than 95% of mid-sized firms build in-house. Going on-premise while running Windows Server 2016 with default passwords is security theatre.

State-level threats (FISA 702, National Security Letters): different calculus. If your competitive IP could conflict with a powerful US company — full sovereignty matters.

Swiss context: FINMA approved most cloud usage for banking. The private banks refusing cloud entirely are typically stricter by choice, not regulation.

Classify your data. Identify your real threat model. Stop using "Cloud Act" as a blanket excuse for not moving.
