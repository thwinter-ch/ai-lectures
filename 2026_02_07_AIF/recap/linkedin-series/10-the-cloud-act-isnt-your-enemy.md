<!-- Post 10/10 | Schedule: Day 5, PM | Topic: The Cloud Act Isn't Your Enemy -->

"We can't use cloud AI because of the Cloud Act."

I hear this in every Swiss finance boardroom. And in most cases, it's wrong.

Let's start with what the Cloud Act actually is. CLOUD stands for "Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data." It's a US law that lets law enforcement request data from US cloud providers, even when stored abroad.

Sounds scary. Here's the number nobody mentions: 95% of Cloud Act requests get rejected by the cloud providers themselves.

These aren't pushover companies. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have entire legal teams whose job is to challenge data requests. They publish transparency reports. They fight in court. Because handing over customer data is terrible for business.

But — and this is important — the real question isn't "can the US government access my data?"

The real question is: who is your actual adversary?

For criminal threats (hackers, ransomware, data theft): major cloud providers offer better security than 95% of mid-sized firms can build in-house. Going on-premise to avoid the Cloud Act while running Windows Server 2016 with default passwords is not a security strategy. It's theater.

For state-level threats (FISA 702, National Security Letters): different calculus entirely. If your competitive intelligence could conflict with a powerful American company, or you're holding data a government might want — full sovereignty matters.

For most Swiss financial firms: FINMA has approved most cloud usage for banking. Data residency requirements exist but are manageable. The private banks that refuse cloud entirely are typically stricter by choice, not by regulation.

Here's what I'd actually do:

1. Classify your data. Not all of it needs the same protection level.
2. Identify your real threat model. Hackers? Competitors? State actors? Each demands a different strategy.
3. Stop using "Cloud Act" as a blanket excuse. It's preventing you from accessing tools that would materially improve your operations.

The Cloud Act is a real consideration. It's not a conversation-ender. And treating it like one is costing you more than you think.
