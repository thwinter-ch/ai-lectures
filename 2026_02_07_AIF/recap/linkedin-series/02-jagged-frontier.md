AI made BCG consultants 40% better at their jobs.

And 19% worse.

Same people. Same AI. Same day.

The difference? Whether the task fell inside or outside AI's capability zone.

Harvard and BCG ran a study with 758 consultants. Inside AI's sweet spot: 12% more tasks completed, 25% faster, 40% higher quality. Genuinely impressive.

But when tasks fell outside that zone — and the consultants didn't realize it — their performance dropped 19 percentage points below working without AI at all.

Not "AI didn't help." AI actively made them worse.

Researchers call this the Jagged Frontier. AI's capabilities aren't a clean line you can memorize. They're ragged, uneven, and — here's the dangerous part — invisible.

AI will confidently give you a wrong answer in the same tone it gives you a brilliant one. It doesn't flag "hey, I'm outside my zone here." It just... keeps going.

This means the most important AI skill isn't prompting. It's frontier awareness.

Knowing where AI is exceptional. Knowing where it's mediocre. And knowing where it will quietly degrade your work while you smile at how fast you're going.

Three things that help:

1. Test AI on tasks where you already know the answer. That calibrates your trust.
2. Be most skeptical when AI is most confident. That's often where the frontier hides.
3. Never skip your own judgment on high-stakes outputs. Speed without accuracy is just fast failure.

The goal isn't to use AI less. It's to use it with your eyes open.
