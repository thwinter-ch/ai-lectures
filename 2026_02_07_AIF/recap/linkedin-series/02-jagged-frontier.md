AI made BCG consultants 40% better.

And 19% worse. Same people. Same AI. Same day.

Harvard and BCG ran it with 758 consultants. Inside AI's capability zone: +12% more tasks, 25% faster, 40% higher quality.

Outside that zone — and the consultants didn't realize they'd crossed it — performance dropped 19 percentage points below working without AI.

Not "AI didn't help." AI actively degraded their work.

Researchers call it the Jagged Frontier. AI capabilities aren't a clean line. They're ragged, uneven, and invisible. AI won't flag "hey, I'm outside my zone." It delivers wrong answers in the same confident tone as brilliant ones.

This is why "just use AI more" is dangerous advice. Without frontier awareness, more AI usage = more confident failure.

I teach this with a diagram and then immediately throw people into a real exercise — company research where they hit both sides of the frontier in 30 minutes. Nothing teaches frontier awareness like feeling it yourself.
