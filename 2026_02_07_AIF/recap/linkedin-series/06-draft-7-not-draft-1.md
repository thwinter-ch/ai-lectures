AI doesn't give you a first draft.

It gives you draft 7.

This one reframe changed how I think about every AI interaction.

Here's what I mean. When you ask AI to write something — an email, a strategy doc, a proposal — the output isn't raw material. It's already been through multiple implicit iterations. It's synthesized patterns, applied structure, smoothed the language.

What comes out is polished. Competent. Reasonable.

It's also not done.

The trap is thinking "wow, that's pretty good" and hitting send. Because draft 7 isn't draft 10. And the distance between 7 and 10 is where your expertise, your judgment, and your voice live.

Draft 7 is missing: your specific client context, the political subtext of the situation, the thing you know but didn't say in the prompt, the tone that signals "I actually wrote this."

The people who use AI well treat it exactly this way. They don't expect perfection. They expect a running start.

Instead of staring at a blank page for 45 minutes, they start with a competent draft 7 and spend 15 minutes turning it into a draft 10 that's genuinely theirs.

That's the real productivity gain. Not "AI did my work." It's "AI eliminated the blank page and the first six rounds of iteration."

Next time you get an AI output, try this: before you accept anything, ask yourself — what would I change if I'd written this myself? What's missing that only I know?

That's your draft 8. Now keep going.
