<!-- Post 8/12 | Schedule: Day 4, PM | Topic: Draft 7, Not Draft 1 | Pillar: AI in Production -->

AI doesn't give you a first draft. It gives you draft 7.

Already synthesized, structured, polished. Competent. Reasonable.

Also not done.

The trap: "wow, that's pretty good" → hit send. Draft 7 isn't draft 10. The gap between 7 and 10 is where your expertise, your judgment, and your actual voice live.

Draft 7 is missing: your client context. The political subtext. The thing you know but didn't say in the prompt. The tone that signals a human wrote this.

I use this framing constantly. Built an entire exercise around it — students create a writing profile first, then use it as context for everything else. The difference between generic AI output and output that sounds like them is that profile document.

The real productivity gain isn't "AI did my work." It's "AI eliminated the blank page and the first six rounds of iteration."

You start at draft 7. You still have to get to 10. But starting at 7 instead of 0 changes everything about how fast you ship.
