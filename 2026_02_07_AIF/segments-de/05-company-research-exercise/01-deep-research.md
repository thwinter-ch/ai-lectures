## Quality Rules

- **Cite every material claim** with (Source, Date) and link
- **No speculation** - mark estimates as [Est.] and show method
- **If sources conflict**, present both and state which you weight more
- **Numbers over adjectives** - "30% growth" not "rapid growth"
- **If no data found**, say exactly: "No reliable public data found."
- **Be exhaustive** - this is deep research, not a summary. Use the full output budget.
