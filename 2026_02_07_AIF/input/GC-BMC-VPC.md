You are a senior, McKinsey-level strategy consultant. Using the research and input bullets provided below, produce a **single, board-ready strategy document** that integrates the **Golden Circle**, **Business Model Canvas (BMC)**, and **Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)** in clear descriptive prose.

**Opening Requirement (McKinsey-style):**

- Begin with a **one-sentence executive maxim** (a concise, McKinsey-style quote) that captures the strategic thesis. Keep it crisp and authoritative.

**Global Output Rules**

- Deliver **one structured document** (no tables, charts, or Excel).
- Follow a **consulting report style**: clear headings, numbered subsections, concise paragraphs.
- In **each subsection**, start with a brief **executive summary (1–2 sentences)**, then provide explanatory detail.
- Use bullets where helpful, but ensure the prose reads like a strategy paper—not a worksheet.
- Maintain a **neutral, professional tone** suitable for executive and board audiences.
- **Length guidance:** ~1,200–2,000 words (flex as needed for clarity).
- **Evidence use:** Ground assertions in the supplied research; if data is absent, state “TBD” or note assumptions explicitly.
- **Consistency:** Ensure Golden Circle ↔ BMC ↔ VPC are mutually consistent; avoid contradictions.
- Do **not** include the acceptance checklist in the final output.

### Part 1 — Golden Circle

Create **three sections in this exact order**:

1. **Why**
    - **Core statement:** Present a single-sentence purpose.
    - **Elaboration (1–2 short paragraphs):** Explain meaning and strategic implications (e.g., market positioning, customer promise, cultural tenets).
2. **How**
    - **Core statement:** Present the signature capabilities/principles.
    - **Elaboration (1–2 short paragraphs):** Describe the operating model choices, differentiators, and proof points linking to the BMC Value Propositions.
3. **What**
    - **Core statement:** Present the offerings/business scope.
    - **Elaboration (1–2 short paragraphs):** Describe the products/services and the outcomes customers should expect; foreshadow key BMC elements.

**Content Input (Golden Circle):**

- **Why:** [bullets]
- **How:** [bullets]
- **What:** [bullets]

### Part 2 — Business Model Canvas (BMC)

Create **nine subsections in this exact order**. For **each**, begin with a **1–2 sentence summary**, then expand into concise bullets with short explanations drawn from the input.

1. **Key Partners**
2. **Key Activities**
3. **Key Resources**
4. **Value Propositions**
5. **Customer Relationships**
6. **Channels**
7. **Customer Segments**
8. **Cost Structure**
9. **Revenue Streams**

**Content Input (BMC):**

[Insert BMC bullets here]

*Guidance:* Tie Value Propositions to the Golden Circle “How/What”, and ensure Customer Segments match the VPC Customer Profile. Where financials are unknown, mark as **TBD** and specify what evidence is needed.

### Part 3 — Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)

Divide into **two main sections** with narrative explanations that expand the bullets into short, descriptive statements.

**Customer Profile**

1. **Jobs to be Done** — What customers are trying to accomplish (functional, emotional, social).
2. **Pains** — Obstacles/risks/frictions; prioritize the severe and frequent.
3. **Gains** — Desired outcomes/benefits; distinguish must-haves vs. delighters.

**Value Map**

4) **Products & Services** — Offerings at a level of specificity that maps to Jobs.

5) **Pain Relievers** — How the offer removes key Pains; be explicit.

6) **Gain Creators** — How the offer enables Gains; link to measurable outcomes.

Conclude the VPC with a **Fit Statement (2–3 sentences)** summarizing how Pain Relievers and Gain Creators address the most critical Jobs/Pains/Gains.

**Content Input (VPC):**

- **Jobs to be Done:** [bullets]
- **Pains:** [bullets]
- **Gains:** [bullets]
- **Products & Services:** [bullets]
- **Pain Relievers:** [bullets]
- **Gain Creators:** [bullets]
