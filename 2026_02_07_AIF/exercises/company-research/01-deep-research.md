## Quality Rules

- **Cite every material claim** with (Source, Date) and link
- **No speculation** - mark estimates as [Est.] and show method
- **If sources conflict**, present both and state which you weight more
- **Numbers over adjectives** - "30% growth" not "rapid growth"
- **If no data found**, say exactly: "No reliable public data found."
```

## Platform Recommendations

| Platform | Strengths | Limitations | Best For |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Perplexity Pro** | Real-time web, auto-citations, source links | Occasional shallow depth | Quick research, citation-heavy output |
| **Claude (web)** | Better analysis, structured output | Slower, fewer sources | Synthesis & strategic framing |
| **ChatGPT (web)** | Good general coverage | Citation quality varies | Broad research sweeps |
| **Gemini** | Strong recent news, Google integration | Can hallucinate details | News-heavy research |

**Recommendation:** Start with Perplexity Pro for facts and citations. Use Claude for synthesis and strategic framing.

---

## Expected Output

After 30 minutes, you should have:

1. **Executive summary** (1 page) - shareable with leadership
2. **Products table** - copy-paste ready
3. **Competitor matrix** - positioning at a glance
4. **Risk flags** - red/amber/green with supporting evidence
5. **Citation trail** - every claim backed by 1+ sources

**Quality bar:** A colleague should be able to use this briefing in a client meeting or board prep without additional research.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "No data found" for financials | Private company - look for funding rounds, headcount proxies, Glassdoor salary data |
| Conflicting numbers | Present both, cite both, note which is more credible and why |
| Output too long | Ask: "Summarize as 10 bullet points with citations" |
| Output too shallow | Follow up: "Go deeper on [specific section]. Cite 3+ sources." |
| Wrong company | Add disambiguating info: "The [City]-based [Industry] company, not the [Other] one" |

---

## Time Allocation

| Phase | Time | Activity |
|-------|------|----------|
| Setup | 2 min | Choose target, fill prompt variables |
| Quick scan | 3 min | Run Quick Start prompt, review initial output |
| Deep dive | 15 min | Run full prompt, iterate on gaps |
| Synthesis | 5 min | Clean up tables, verify citations |
| Capture | 5 min | Save output, note follow-up questions |

---

## After the Workshop

Take your research output and:

1. **Identify 3 actionable insights** you didn't know before
2. **Flag 2 questions** to verify with primary sources (calls, meetings)
3. **Share one finding** with a colleague who could use it

The goal isn't a perfect report - it's building the muscle memory for AI-assisted research that gets you to "informed enough to act" in under an hour.
