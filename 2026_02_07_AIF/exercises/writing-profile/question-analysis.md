# Writing Profile: Question Analysis

Selection of 10 high-signal questions from the 100-question Taste Interview framework.

---

## Selected Questions (10)

### 1. What do you believe about writing that most people in your field would disagree with?
**Category:** Beliefs & Contrarian Takes
**Rationale:** Reveals foundational stance and filters out generic "good writing" platitudes -- the answer exposes what makes their worldview non-default.

### 2. Words you would never use, and why?
**Category:** Writing Mechanics
**Rationale:** Hard constraints are more actionable than preferences; a banned-word list immediately calibrates vocabulary and reveals pet peeves.

### 3. Show me a sentence you've written that you're proud of. What makes it work?
**Category:** Writing Mechanics
**Rationale:** Forces concrete output, not theory; the example + self-analysis exposes both style DNA and their mental model of "good."

### 4. What makes you immediately distrust a piece of content?
**Category:** Red Flags
**Rationale:** Negative constraints are sharper than positive ones; this reveals their bullshit detector and what signals "fake" to them.

### 5. What specific phrase or writing pattern feels like nails on a chalkboard?
**Category:** Aesthetic Crimes
**Rationale:** Visceral dislikes are stable and non-negotiable; this captures what they'll never tolerate in their own work.

### 6. How do you use humor -- and when would you never use it?
**Category:** Voice & Personality
**Rationale:** Humor is the hardest thing to fake; knowing their comedic register (and its boundaries) is voice-defining.

### 7. What's one writing rule you break intentionally -- and why?
**Category:** Writing Mechanics
**Rationale:** Deliberate rule-breaking exposes their theory of craft; distinguishes thoughtful voice from mere sloppiness.

### 8. How do you open a piece? Show me your default first-sentence pattern.
**Category:** Structural Preferences
**Rationale:** Openings are the highest-leverage structural choice; a concrete pattern here is immediately usable for imitation.

### 9. What approach to writing would you never take, even if it worked?
**Category:** Hard Nos
**Rationale:** Ethical/aesthetic lines reveal values; this separates "not my style" from "incompatible with who I am."

### 10. What's your tone when you're skeptical vs. when you're excited?
**Category:** Voice & Personality
**Rationale:** Tonal range is essential for voice calibration; knowing both poles lets the AI modulate appropriately.

| Structural Preferences (15) | 8 | Yes |
| Hard Nos (10) | 9 | Yes |
| Red Flags (10) | 4 | Yes |

**Coverage:** All 7 categories represented. Weighted toward Writing Mechanics (3) and Voice & Personality (2) as these have highest practical impact on output mimicry.

## Excluded High-Value Questions

### "What type of content do you find lazy or uninspired?"
**Why excluded:** Overlaps with both Red Flags (#4) and Aesthetic Crimes (#5); the nails-on-chalkboard question gets the same information with more emotional punch.

### "How do you handle transitions between ideas?"
**Why excluded:** High craft value but hard to articulate in 2-3 sentences; most people can't describe this well without producing multiple examples, which balloons answer length.

### "What's the hot take you'd defend to the death?"
**Why excluded:** Strong differentiator but domain-specific (might be about their industry, not writing itself); the contrarian belief question (#1) captures the same signal with broader applicability.

### "What do you sound like when you're being serious vs. casual?"
**Why excluded:** Valuable for tone calibration but nearly identical to question #10 (skeptical vs. excited); the latter captures more dynamic range.

### "Words you overuse and wish you didn't?"
**Why excluded:** Interesting self-awareness signal but less actionable than the banned-words list; overuse patterns often require corpus analysis to identify anyway.

## Usage Notes

These 10 questions can be asked in ~15-20 minutes. Answers should be 2-3 sentences each, ideally with at least one concrete example per question.

The set prioritizes:
- **Negative constraints** (what NOT to do) over positive aspirations
- **Concrete examples** over abstract descriptions
- **Visceral reactions** over reasoned positions
- **Actionable specifics** over general principles

This yields a voice profile that's immediately usable for style imitation, not just theoretically descriptive.
