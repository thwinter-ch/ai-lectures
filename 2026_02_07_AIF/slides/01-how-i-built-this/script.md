# How I Built This Lecture — Speaker Script

**Segment:** 01 | **Duration:** 15 minutes | **Position:** Opening segment

---

## Opening Hook [0:00–2:00]

> "Before we get into AI productivity hacks, I want to show you something. This lecture — the one you're sitting in right now — was built using AI. Not just written by AI. Architected, researched, planned, and produced using the exact tools I'm going to teach you today."
>
> [Pause]
>
> "This isn't theory. This is me eating my own cooking."

**Key point:** The meta-demonstration. Credibility through dogfooding.

**Transition:** "Let me walk you through exactly how this happened."

---

## The Dogfooding Principle [2:00–3:30]

> "In tech, we call this 'dogfooding' — using your own product. If you're selling productivity tools, you better be productive. If you're teaching AI workflows, those workflows better have built the thing you're teaching."

**Why this matters:**

- Proves the tools work beyond controlled demos
- Exposes friction points you'd never find otherwise
- Forces honest assessment of what's actually useful vs. what sounds good

**Rhetorical beat:** "So let me show you the receipts."

---

## The Stack [3:30–8:00]

Walk through each tool. Be specific. Show screenshots if available.

### 1. Wispr Flow — Voice Capture (30 seconds)

> "It started with voice. I was walking, thinking about this lecture, and I just started talking. Wispr Flow captured it — voice to text, directly into my notes."

**Key point:** Ideas don't wait for you to sit at a keyboard. Voice capture removes friction.

### 2. Perplexity — Research (60 seconds)

> "That raw brain dump became a research prompt. I fed it to Perplexity: 'What do financial executives struggle with? What are the pain points around information overload?' It came back with citations, stats, competitive frameworks."

**Key point:** Research that used to take a junior analyst days now takes 15 minutes.

### 3. Claude Code — Planning + Parallel Agents (90 seconds)

> "Here's where it gets interesting. Claude Code isn't just a chatbot — it's an orchestrator. I gave it the research, the structure, the constraints. It spun up parallel agents: one writing scripts, one building slide prompts, one organizing exercise files. All coordinated."

**Key point:** You're not talking to one AI. You're directing a team.

**Specific example:** "While one agent wrote the information overload script, another was building the company research exercise. They don't wait for each other. They work in parallel, then sync."

### 4. GAMMA — Slides (60 seconds)

> "The slide prompts — which we'll use in exercises today — went into GAMMA. Text in, slides out. No wrestling with PowerPoint. No hunting for stock photos. Just structured content that becomes visual."

**Key point:** Slides are now a text generation problem, not a design problem.

### 5. Notion — Knowledge Capture (60 seconds)

> "Everything lands in Notion. Every decision, every iteration, every prompt that worked. It's my second brain. Next time I build a lecture, I don't start from zero — I start from patterns that already worked."

**Key point:** The system learns. Every project makes the next one faster.

## The Timeline [8:00–10:00]

Show the actual development arc:

| Phase | What Happened | Tool |
|-------|---------------|------|
| **January 24, 7:30 PM** | Voice brainstorm while walking | Wispr Flow |
| **January 24, 8:00 PM** | Structured research + initial brief | Perplexity |
| **January 25–30** | Parallel development of modules | Claude Code |
| **January 31** | Final integration and polish | Claude Code + GAMMA |
| **Ongoing** | Knowledge capture for next iteration | Notion |

**Key insight:** "From voice note to delivered lecture in under two weeks. And I wasn't working on this full-time. This was background process while doing actual work."

---

## What This Changes [10:00–12:30]

**The old model:**

- Outline (manual)
- Research (manual, slow)
- Write (linear, one slide at a time)
- Design (separate skill, separate tool)
- Review (start to finish, sequential)

**The new model:**

- Capture (voice, anytime)
- Research (AI-accelerated, 10x faster)
- Orchestrate (parallel agents, non-linear)
- Generate (content → visuals automatically)
- Iterate (fast cycles, not perfect drafts)

**The shift:** "I went from 'creating content' to 'directing production.' My job is to define the vision and quality bar. The execution scales."

---

## The Honest Caveats [12:30–13:30]

Don't oversell. Be real.

> "Is every output perfect? No. AI gets things wrong. It hallucinates. It goes generic if you let it."

**What still requires human judgment:**

- Knowing what to cut (AI loves to include everything)
- Tone calibration (AI defaults to corporate)
- Domain expertise (AI doesn't know your audience like you do)
- The final pass (always, always human eyes)

**Key line:** "AI gives you draft 7 instead of draft 1. You still need to get to draft 10."

---

## Bridge to Session [13:30–14:30]

> "Today, you're going to build pieces of this system for yourself. Not the whole thing — that takes time. But the foundations: a writing profile that makes AI sound like you, a research workflow that cuts hours to minutes, a knowledge capture habit that compounds."

**Preview of what's coming:**

1. Writing style profile (Ruben Hassid method)
2. Company research exercise (structured AI briefings)
3. Second brain setup (Notion + Claude integration)

**Reframe:** "You're not learning tools. You're building infrastructure. The payoff isn't today — it's every day after."

---

## Close [14:30–15:00]

**One-liner to land:**

> "The best way to understand AI productivity is to see it produce. You just did. Now let's build yours."

**Transition:**

"First up: We're going to tackle information overload — the problem this entire system is designed to solve."

## Timing Checkpoints

| Time | You should be at... |
|------|---------------------|
| 2:00 | Finished opening hook |
| 3:30 | Finished dogfooding principle |
| 8:00 | Finished walking through the stack |
| 10:00 | Finished timeline |
| 12:30 | Finished "what this changes" |
| 13:30 | Finished honest caveats |
| 14:30 | Finished bridge to session |
| 15:00 | Transition to next segment |

---

## If Running Short

- Compress the stack walkthrough (hit only Perplexity + Claude Code)
- Skip the timeline table, just give the headline ("two weeks, background process")

## If Running Long

- Cut the "old model vs. new model" comparison
- Trim the caveats section to one line

---

## Key Phrases to Land

- "Eating my own cooking"
- "Directing production, not creating content"
- "Draft 7 instead of draft 1"
- "Infrastructure, not tools"
- "Background process while doing actual work"

## Notes

**Energy:** This is the opening. Set the tone — confident, practical, slightly irreverent. You're not a tech evangelist. You're a practitioner showing your work.

**Authenticity:** Don't make it sound too polished. The point is that this process has friction, takes iteration, and requires judgment. That's what makes it credible.

**Visual support:** If you can show actual screenshots of Claude Code running parallel agents, or a Notion database with lecture content, do it. Receipts > claims.
