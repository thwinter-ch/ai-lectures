# GAMMA Prompt — How I Built This Lecture

**Duration:** 15 minutes | **Slides:** 8–10

---

## Overall Style

- Clean, modern, dark or deep blue background
- Minimal text — speaker carries the story, slides anchor key points
- Icons: Simple, monoline style (no 3D, no gradients)
- No stock photos of people working at computers (overdone)
- Accent color for highlights: Electric blue or teal against dark
- Font: Sans-serif, modern (Inter, DM Sans, or similar)

---

## Slide 1: Title

**Title:** How I Built This Lecture

**Subtitle:** Using AI to Build a Lecture About AI

**Visual:** Simple recursive/meta icon — e.g., a slide inside a slide, or a loop symbol

**Talking points:**
- "This lecture was built using AI. Let me show you the receipts."
- Set up the meta-demonstration

---

## Slide 2: The Dogfooding Principle

**Title:** Eating My Own Cooking

**Layout:** Single concept, large text

**Main text:** "If you're teaching AI workflows, those workflows better have built what you're teaching."

**Subtext (smaller):** In tech, we call this *dogfooding* — using your own product.

**Visual:** Simple icon — fork and plate, or recursive loop

**Talking points:**
- Proves the tools work
- Exposes real friction
- Forces honesty about what actually helps

---

## Slide 3: The Stack

**Title:** The Tools That Built This

**Layout:** 5 horizontal tool cards in a row or stacked vertically

| Tool | Role |
|------|------|
| **Wispr Flow** | Voice capture — ideas while walking |
| **Perplexity** | Research with citations |
| **Claude Code** | Planning + parallel agents |
| **GAMMA** | Slides from text prompts |
| **Notion** | Knowledge capture and iteration |

**Visual:** Each tool as an icon or logo placeholder with its one-liner function

**Talking points:**
- Walk through each briefly
- "You'll use most of these today"

---

## Slide 4: Voice to Research

**Title:** It Started with Voice

**Layout:** Simple flow diagram (left to right)

```
Walking + Thinking  →  Wispr Flow  →  Raw Notes  →  Perplexity  →  Structured Research
```

**Visual:** Icons for each step (person walking, microphone, notepad, search icon, document)

**Talking points:**
- Ideas don't wait for keyboards
- Research that took days now takes minutes

---

## Slide 5: Parallel Agents

**Title:** Orchestration, Not Conversation

**Layout:** Central hub with spokes

```
          [Claude Code]
              ↓
   ┌─────────┼─────────┐
   ↓         ↓         ↓
Script    Slides   Exercises
Agent     Agent     Agent
```

**Visual:** Hub-and-spoke diagram showing parallel work streams

**Key quote to display:** "You're not talking to one AI. You're directing a team."

**Talking points:**
- Parallel execution, not sequential
- Script writing while exercises build
- Coordination happens automatically

---

## Slide 6: The Timeline

**Title:** Two Weeks, Background Process

**Layout:** Horizontal timeline

| Date | Phase | Tools |
|------|-------|-------|
| Jan 24 | Voice brainstorm | Wispr Flow |
| Jan 24 | Research + brief | Perplexity |
| Jan 25–30 | Parallel development | Claude Code |
| Jan 31 | Final integration | Claude Code + GAMMA |
| Ongoing | Knowledge capture | Notion |

**Visual:** Timeline with dots and connecting line, tool icons above each phase

**Talking points:**
- Not full-time work — background process
- While doing actual work, this was building

---

## Slide 7: The Shift

**Title:** From Creator to Director

**Layout:** Two-column comparison

| Old Model | New Model |
|-----------|-----------|
| Manual outline | Voice capture |
| Slow research | AI-accelerated (10x) |
| Linear writing | Parallel agents |
| Separate design | Auto-generated visuals |
| Sequential review | Fast iteration cycles |

**Visual:** Simple left/right split, contrasting colors (gray vs. bright)

**Key quote to display:** "I went from creating content to directing production."

**Talking points:**
- The job changes: vision and quality bar
- Execution scales; judgment doesn't

---

## Slide 8: The Honest Caveats

**Title:** What AI Can't Do (Yet)

**Layout:** Vertical list with small icons

- **Knowing what to cut** — AI includes everything
- **Tone calibration** — AI defaults to corporate
- **Domain expertise** — AI doesn't know your audience
- **The final pass** — Always human eyes

**Visual:** Simple warning/caution icon next to title

**Key quote to display:** "AI gives you draft 7 instead of draft 1. You still need to get to draft 10."

**Talking points:**
- Don't oversell
- Human judgment is the bottleneck that matters

---

## Slide 9: What You'll Build Today

**Title:** Your Turn

**Layout:** Three numbered items

1. **Writing Style Profile** — AI that sounds like you
2. **Company Research Workflow** — Hours to minutes
3. **Second Brain Setup** — Knowledge that compounds

**Visual:** Checklist or numbered blocks

**Subtext:** "You're not learning tools. You're building infrastructure."

**Talking points:**
- These are foundations
- Payoff isn't today — it's every day after

---

## Slide 10: The Takeaway

**Title:** See It. Build It.

**Layout:** Single quote, large text, centered

> "The best way to understand AI productivity is to see it produce. You just did. Now let's build yours."

**Visual:** Clean, minimal, quote stands alone

**Talking points:**
- Let it land
- Transition: "First up — information overload"

---

## GAMMA Settings

- **Presentation length:** Concise (8–10 slides)
- **Tone:** Professional, direct, slightly irreverent
- **Color scheme:** Dark mode, high contrast (navy/charcoal + electric accent)
- **Transitions:** Simple fade, no distracting animations
- **Font:** Sans-serif, modern

---

## Notes for GAMMA Import

When pasting this into GAMMA:

1. Start with: "Create a presentation about how this lecture was built using AI tools"
2. Paste the slide-by-slide structure above
3. Specify: "Use minimal text, dark professional theme, simple icons"
4. Request: "No stock photos, use diagrams and clean icons"
5. Add: "Tone should be confident and practical, not hype-y"

GAMMA will generate visuals — review and replace anything that feels generic or overly corporate.

## Visual Assets to Prepare

If available, include actual screenshots:

- Claude Code terminal showing parallel agent execution
- Notion database with lecture content rows
- GAMMA interface with a prompt → slide preview

Receipts > claims. Real screenshots beat icons every time.
