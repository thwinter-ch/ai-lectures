# Cognitive Limits — Speaker Script

**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Position:** Early in lecture (after "Why AI?" / before practical exercises)
**Purpose:** Establish the cognitive case for AI augmentation

## Slide 1: The Elephant in the Room (1.5 min)

**[OPEN WITH PROVOCATION]**

"Before we build anything, let's talk about why you actually need this.

Not because AI is trendy. Not because your competitors are doing it. Because your brain — the brain you rely on for every strategic decision — has a hard limit. And that limit hasn't changed in 10,000 years.

Today you're making decisions with the same cognitive hardware as a prehistoric hunter-gatherer. Except instead of tracking a deer, you're tracking market movements, regulatory changes, team dynamics, client needs, and competitive threats. Simultaneously."

**[PAUSE — let it land]**

## Slide 2: Miller's Law — The 7±2 Constraint (2 min)

**[INTRODUCE THE RESEARCH]**

"In 1956, cognitive psychologist George Miller published a paper called 'The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two.' It's one of the most cited papers in psychology.

What he found: Human working memory can hold roughly 7 items at once. Some people manage 9, some struggle with 5. But nobody escapes this constraint.

**[MAKE IT CONCRETE]**

Think about what this means for your work:
- You're in a board meeting. Six agenda items deep. Someone raises a new concern. Your brain is already at capacity.
- You're reviewing a deal. Financial projections, market analysis, competitive positioning, regulatory risk, team capability, timing. That's already 6 variables — and we haven't even talked about the things you should be considering but can't hold in mind.

This isn't a personal failing. It's biological architecture. Every executive in this room operates within the same 7±2 prison."

## Slide 3: Decision Fatigue — The Quality Cliff (2.5 min)

**[BUILD ON THE CONSTRAINT]**

"It gets worse. Not only is your working memory limited — it depletes.

Research from Roy Baumeister and colleagues shows that decision quality degrades with each choice you make. By some estimates, the average person makes 35,000 decisions per day. Executives? Probably more.

**[THE JUDGE STUDY]**

The most famous study: Israeli parole judges. Researchers analyzed 1,100 parole decisions. What determined whether a prisoner got released?

Not the crime. Not the prisoner's behavior. The biggest predictor was *when* the case was heard.

- After breakfast: 65% approval rate
- Right before lunch: nearly 0%

Judges weren't evil — they were depleted. When cognitive resources run low, the brain defaults to the safe choice. In parole cases, that's 'no.' In your business, that might be 'let's table this' or 'stick with what we know.'

**[LAND THE POINT]**

Every afternoon decision you make is potentially compromised. Not by information asymmetry — by glucose levels."

## Slide 4: The Data Explosion (2 min)

**[SHIFT TO THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT]**

"Now here's the context collision.

Your brain: unchanged for 10,000 years.

The data environment: exponentially accelerating.

**[THE STATS]**

- More data was created between 2020 and 2025 than in all prior human history combined.
- Global data volume: ~97 zettabytes in 2022, projected to hit 181 zettabytes by 2025.
- One zettabyte = one trillion gigabytes.

Let me make that tangible: If you printed the data created in 2020 alone, the stack of paper would reach from Earth to Pluto. Ten times.

**[THE MISMATCH]**

This is the fundamental mismatch of modern knowledge work:
- Information supply: exponential
- Human processing capacity: fixed
- Result: Chronic overwhelm, missed signals, reactive decision-making"

- Statista Data Volume estimates

## Slide 5: Human Bandwidth — The Bottleneck (2 min)

**[QUANTIFY HUMAN LIMITS]**

"Let's put numbers on the bottleneck.

Human reading speed: ~250 words per minute for comprehension
Human typing speed: ~40 words per minute average
Human speaking speed: ~125-150 words per minute
Human attention span: studies vary, but meaningful focus sessions are 20-50 minutes before performance drops

**[THE AUDIT]**

Now do the math on your inbox. If you receive 100 emails a day averaging 200 words each, that's 20,000 words. At 250 wpm, that's 80 minutes of pure reading — assuming zero interruptions and perfect focus. Just for email. Before you've read a report, attended a meeting, or made a decision.

**[THE KEY INSIGHT]**

The solution is not 'work harder.' The solution is not 'be more disciplined.' Those are moral framings for a structural problem.

The solution is offload. External systems that extend your cognitive capacity. What we used to call 'tools.'"

## Slide 6: The Case for AI Augmentation (2.5 min)

**[REFRAME AI]**

"This is why I'm not interested in 'AI replacing humans.' That's the wrong frame.

I'm interested in AI extending humans. The same way:
- Writing extended memory (we don't memorize everything — we write it down)
- Calculators extended arithmetic (you don't do compound interest in your head)
- Search engines extended recall (you don't memorize the phone book)

AI extends cognitive processing. Not replacement — augmentation.

**[THE THREE OFFLOADS]**

What can you offload to AI?

1. **Memory and Recall** — Store everything, retrieve on demand. Your 'second brain' doesn't forget.

2. **Pattern Processing** — Synthesize large document sets, spot anomalies, surface connections you'd miss.

3. **First-Draft Generation** — Let AI handle the blank page problem. You edit. Editing is faster than creating.

**[THE RETAINED ROLE]**

What stays with you?

- Judgment. Context. Ethics. Strategy.
- Knowing which questions to ask.
- Making the call when the data is ambiguous.
- Being accountable for outcomes.

AI doesn't replace thinking. It gives you more capacity to think about what matters."

## Slide 7: Bridge to Second Brain (2 min)

**[TRANSITION TO PRACTICAL]**

"So here's where we're headed.

The exercises today are designed around this principle: offload cognitive load, preserve cognitive authority.

We're building what's called a 'Second Brain' — a term popularized by Tiago Forte. It's a personal knowledge management system that:

- Captures information so you don't have to hold it in memory
- Organizes information so you can find it when needed
- Processes information so it's ready for decision-making
- Surfaces information proactively when context is relevant

**[PREVIEW]**

In the next modules:
- GitHub becomes your external memory (version-controlled, searchable)
- Notion becomes your organized retrieval system
- AI becomes the intelligence layer that connects and classifies

**[CLOSE THE LOOP]**

You're not building a productivity system because productivity is virtuous. You're building it because your brain has a 7-item limit and the world has 181 zettabytes of data.

That gap? That's the problem we're solving today."
