- **Action Items:** [Any tasks or follow-ups identified]
- **Key Insights:** [Main takeaways, 2-3 bullet points]

## Output Format
Provide the classification in YAML format so it can be easily added to Notion:

```yaml
type: 
priority: 
status: 
tags: []
related_to: []
action_items: []
key_insights: []
summary: 
```

After classification, suggest which Notion database this should be added to.

```

```

4. **Setting Up AI Integrations**

### Key Messages to Emphasize

1. **This is infrastructure, not a project:** Like building a house, it requires initial investment but pays dividends forever
2. **Imperfect action beats perfect planning:** Start simple, iterate as you go
3. **The system serves you, not the other way around:** If something doesn't work, change it
4. **AI is a tool, not a replacement:** You're still the curator, analyst, and decision-maker

### Common Objections \& Responses

**"I don't have time to set this up"**

- Response: The setup takes 4 hours today. The time saved starts tomorrow and compounds daily.

**"My company has security concerns about cloud tools"**

- Response: This is your personal knowledge system. Keep company-confidential information in your corporate systems. This is for your insights, learning, and personal productivity.

**"I'm not technical enough"**

- Response: We're using cloud tools with visual interfaces. No coding required. If you can use email, you can do this.

**"What if the tools change or go away?"**

- Response: That's why we use markdown and GitHub. Your knowledge is portable, not locked into proprietary formats.


### Timing Flexibility

- Core modules: 3 hours
