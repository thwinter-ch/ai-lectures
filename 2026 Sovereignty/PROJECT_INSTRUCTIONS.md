# Project: Data & AI Sovereignty Lecture Materials

## Objective
Create educational materials explaining data and AI sovereignty concepts for board-level audiences, based on Thomas Winter's lecture framing from the HWZ CAS VR course.

## Core Definitions to Establish

1. **Data Sovereignty** = Only the law of the country you are in applies to your data
2. **Data Residency** = Physical location of data (necessary but not sufficient)
3. **Absolute Sovereignty** = Even under coercion/threat to provider, adversaries cannot access data via provider—must come directly to data owner

## Key Concepts to Cover

### Legal Framework (US perspective as primary threat model)
- CLOUD Act (2018) - extraterritorial reach
- Patriot Act - surveillance foundation
- FISA 702 - foreign intelligence surveillance
- National Security Letters - gag-ordered administrative subpoenas

### Hyperscaler Reality Check (as of January 2026)
- What AWS/Azure/Google claim to offer
- What they actually deliver
- What they cannot legally promise (under oath admissions)

### Defense Levels by Threat Model
- Level 1: Compliance (hyperscaler sovereign regions)
- Level 2: Foreign intelligence (EU-owned infrastructure)
- Level 3: Coercive actors (air-gapped, self-operated)
- Level 4: Physical access threats (HSMs, distributed keys)

## Deliverables

| File | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `Data_and_AI_Sovereignty_Guide.md` | Complete | 2-3 page board-level guide |
| Slides (if needed) | TBD | Visual presentation format |
| Case studies | TBD | Real-world examples (ICC/Microsoft, NATO/Google) |
